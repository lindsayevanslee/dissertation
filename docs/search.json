    "text": "The twelfth-century Anglo-Norman verse redaction of La Vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne known as Version T was a popular saint’s Life in the later medieval period, and has been lauded, in the past few decades, for the quality of its verse and the ingenuity of the anonymous poet’s handling of the Latin source. Since its last edition in the late 1970s, the rise of New Philology and advances in digital methods call for a new edition of this exceptional text. Situating readers within both the literary scholarship surrounding the Life and debates concerning the role of digital methods in medieval studies, this dissertation presents a digital edition of Version T. Rather than collapsing T into a single normalized text, this edition foregrounds the multiplicity of the corpus. Its multi-column format renders editorial interventions transparent — ranging from nearly diplomatic transcription to extensive normalization — and invites readers to explore the text through degrees of mediation. Focusing especially on Version T’s most distinctive feature — the two portraits of Mary the Egyptian describing her first as a luxurious sinner and then as a devout ascetic —, the dissertation uses these passages as a test case for visualizing textual variation. Editorial work — I argue — is not merely reproductive but is itself an interpretive intervention, shaping resulting academic discourse surrounding the text. By making editorial labor apparent and variance clear, this approach supports rigorous literary analysis grounded in concrete textual evidence and offers a model for digital editions that balance fidelity to material sources with legibility.\nThe Introduction provides an overview of Version T and its critical reception, proposing editorial approaches that treat T as a plural body of texts. Chapter 1 evaluates how scholars currently discover, study, edit, and share medieval texts, offering a brief case study of the now-lost fragment T-F2. Examining the limitations of print and addressing counterarguments to digital methods, Chapter 1 advocates for digital methods rooted in material sources. Divided into two parts, Chapter 2 details the development and execution of the digital edition. Part 1 recounts the process of transcribing, encoding, and editing the available manuscript copies of T — material supplied in Appendix 2 as an initial step toward a complete edition. Part 2 offers the T portraits with English translations, using visualization techniques to clarify variance more effectively than traditional paratextual notes. This material supports the interpretive work of Chapter 3, which performs a close, comparative reading of the portraits, tracing patterns of negation, color, and metaphor to illuminate the text’s complex theological positioning of Mary as desirable. While the portraits alone vary modestly, the aggregation of differences across the T corpus provides stronger evidence for more confident and nuanced literary interpretations. Appendix 1 examines the T codices and addresses challenges of access, underscoring the importance of supplemental resources. Finally, adopting a digital format that integrates static and dynamic content, this dissertation embodies the push for more digitally forward scholarly work, reflecting a commitment to leveraging technology to enhance the accessibility, visualization, and interpretation of medieval texts.\nKeywords: Mary the Egyptian; Version T; digital editing; medieval manuscript studies; hagiography",

    "text": "Of Scholars, Librarians, and Manuscripts\nConsider the case of Erik Rankka (1914-2009), former Docent of Uppsala University in Sweden and editor of Li ver del juïse: Sermon en vers du XIIe siècle (1982) whose edition intersects with this dissertation through his work on three manuscripts in the Version T corpus (T-B, T-D, and T-F1). On October 25th, 1977, Rankka used his typewriter to draft a letter to the librarian of the John Rylands Library in Manchester, requesting a microfilm copy of MS French 6 and any other information regarding the manuscript that they might provide.1 He signed this letter and with it included a letter of endorsement from his colleague Professor Kurt Baldinger and a copy of the 1923 Romania article by Fawtier and Fawtier-Jones in support of his request. Presumably, sometime later, Rankka received his requested microfilm,2 so that he might study MS French 6 from the comfort of the library at Uppsala and possibly inform a future visit to Manchester in person. Similarly, on August 14th, 2021, I used my Macbook Air to submit a digital inquiry to the Manchester Digital Collections website, asking if French 6 had been digitized. On August 17th, Special Collections Librarian Charlotte Hoare supplied me, via email, with a link to the full color digitization of French 6 as well as the digitized 1930 handlist by Moses Tyson describing the manuscript.3 Like Rankka, who worked remotely on his edition thanks to his microfilm copy, I was able to inform this project from a distance before justifying an in-person visit to the John Rylands in September 2022, where I was welcomed and encouraged by their kind and knowledgeable staff.\nCentral to both these narratives is a profound indebtedness to the work of those — librarians, curators, catalogers, and the many manuscript scholars who come before us — whose dedication ensures the preservation, accessibility, and comprehensibility of manuscript collections, thereby fundamentally enabling all associated research. The intellectual labor involved in maintaining these objects and curating these collections is not merely administrative; it embodies a deep engagement with the artifacts under our care and represents an essential component of our scholarly ecosystem. Librarians protect and maintain manuscript collections; catalogers render these collections searchable and individual manuscripts discoverable; editors and translators ensure that the texts within these manuscripts are made legible to a wider audience; and other scholars, of course, build on this groundwork to make insightful contributions that highlight the significance of these manuscripts and inform the collecting choices and other work of the librarians and so on. The cycle continues. All of this shared attention augments a manuscript’s value — both its monetary and its incalculable cultural value — and likewise augments the value we place on the texts recorded within these manuscripts. The manuscripts we choose to devote our time and attention to ultimately shape our perceptions of the medieval past and its literature, of its people and its diverse productions. All of those involved, therefore, in the maintenance, curation, and study of medieval manuscripts bear a significant responsibility to preserve and make clear what these objects are and what they might tell us. It is through the meticulous care and collaborative spirit of every person involved in this cycle of scholarship that our field continues to thrive and evolve. Inalienable from our scholarly endeavors are the human relationships formed between researchers and the custodians of our research objects, ensuring that our field not only persists but flourishes.\nFurthermore, this comparison between the work of Rankka and myself illustrates how the fundamental procedures we follow — reaching out to special collections librarians, arranging access, and consulting materials — have changed little over time. However, the tools at our disposal have become more diverse and sophisticated. Manuscript research has undergone significant developments over the past several decades, particularly with the advent of digital technologies. The digital turn has made many manuscripts and their associated metadata available online, allowing researchers to conduct much of their work from locations far removed from the special collections reading room, while in no way diminishing the valuable insights that can only come from consulting manuscripts and their curators in person. Even email has accelerated correspondences between special collections librarians and researchers, making it easier than ever to access materials and arrange visits. And yet, it is important to remember that, despite these new developments, the work of manuscript scholars today remains fundamentally the same, and it is this fundamental continuity in combination with the adoption of helpful innovation that is essential to the production of thorough research that builds over time. While our tools may change, the collaborative and human foundations of manuscript research remain constant. The same intellectual labor — careful cataloging, skilled preservation, informed interpretation — continues to sustain our field. Digital technologies do not replace this labor; they extend it. To embrace digital methods is not to abandon traditional scholarship or the relationships that make it possible, but to carry them forward with new capacities. Digital scholarship, at its best, strengthens our ability to ask and answer humanities questions. Manuscripts are not just data; they are objects of care — preserved, interpreted, and made both available and meaningful through the enduring efforts of those who steward them.\n\nWith this in mind, I enter the manuscript studies ecosystem through this dissertation, viewing editing, in particular, as an instrumental, yet often underappreciated, element that not only reproduces texts but actively reshapes scholarly conversations. In his seminal work Éloge de la variante (1989), Bernard Cerquiglini underscores the major — and often contentious — influence of editing on linguistic and literary interpretation:\nDespite the centrality of editing to the ways we access and understand medieval texts, editors and translators often remain in the background, perceived as passive intermediaries rather than active contributors to the formation of knowledge. In reality, editors exert a great deal of largely invisible power — deciding which texts are most worthy of our attention and why, lowering the barriers to new research of old texts, shaping both the selection of works available to us and how we might read those works as we craft our teaching curricula. Stephen G. Nichols, reflecting on the relationship between editions, course content, and research, writes in From Parchment to Cyberspace (2016):\nHere, Nichols calls attention to the filtering effect of editorial practice: what appears as a faithful window into the past is, in fact, a carefully constructed frame. This realization demonstrates the almost shocking extent to which editorial choices sway the formation of the medieval canon — what we teach, what we cite, and what we choose to study. Michelle Warren makes a similar point in Holy Digital Grail (2022) where she draws attention to the reciprocal relationship between our publishing practices and canon formation:\nIn this light, the longstanding authority of older editions — not infrequently governed by assumptions we might now consider outdated — continues to shape the boundaries of the filed. And so, it is the flawed perception of editors as neutral transmitters of texts that must be re-examined so that what we read, study and teach remains aligned with the most current and rigorous understandings available to us.\nIn taking the form of a digital edition, this dissertation seeks to disrupt the pervasive view in academia that editors and translators are merely conveying texts with minimal scholarly intervention and even without doing challenging, intellectual labor. As an editor, I seek to make Version T of La Vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne more legible to a wider audience, and as a digital editor, I advocate for the adoption of innovative methods to both strengthen and complicate our analysis of medieval texts, furthering the perpetual reexamination of our editing practices.\nIn structuring this dissertation, I offer an edition of a text with a robust justification for its digital format. Each chapter builds on the last to address current challenges and opportunities in digitizing and digitally editing medieval manuscripts (Chapter 1), provide a more transparent view of the editorial process (Chapter 2), and demonstrate through a close literary analysis how such an edition can reshape our understanding of the text (Chapter 3). As a whole, this dissertation not only serves as an academic study of a single text but also as an experimental model for future projects, taking advantage of digital tools to foster a more dynamic interaction between the text, its various manuscript witnesses, and the modern reader. By integrating new and old methods, my dissertation lays a new stepping stone in the path of research into Version T of La Vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne, encouraging further exploration of this surprising text. My approach builds upon the work of previous specialists but also sets the stage for future researchers to continue our shared analysis of this text and its material manuscripts through digital means.",

    "section": "Why Version T?",
    "text": "Why Version T?\nThe twelfth-century Anglo-Norman verse redaction of the Life of Mary the Egyptian known as Version T was written by an anonymous poet in the vernacular and appears to have had a considerable influence on the saint’s cult more broadly in the West. Version T tells the story of Mary, a penitent saint who began her life as a Christian girl from a high-class home. Despite this privileged upbringing, the T-poet notes that she was “badly taught,”4 and at the age of twelve, she decides to leave her home and potential marriage prospects in favor of a life alone in Alexandria where she takes up sex work. For years, her many lovers lavish her with fine gifts and shed one another’s blood at her doorstep. Eventually, Mary travels by boat to Jerusalem with a group of pilgrims, paying for her passage with the gift of her body. While in the holy land, Mary experiences a great epiphany. She renounces her former way of life, adopts the Virgin as her guarantor, and flees to the desert beyond the river Jordan with only three loaves of bread and the clothes on her back. Living out the rest of her days as an ascetic, she trades soft beds for hard stone, she grazes on grass and drinks directly from streams, her clothes disintegrate and are replaced by her enveloping, white hair, and her skin blackens. Yet in spite of these harsh conditions, the T-poet portrays her as being perfectly content in her asceticism; in the wilderness, she is provided for5 and lives undisturbed by any beast.6 Ultimately, she is met by Zozimas (sometimes Zosimas), a holy man who witnesses her many miracles, learns a profound lesson in humility through the model of this Desert Mother, and shares the story of her life with the brothers of his monastery just as the T-poet transmits this saint’s Life to the reader.\nBut why does Version T, among all the various French accounts of Mary’s life, merit particular attention at all?7 To begin with, it is the most substantial and well-crafted verse redaction of the legend in the French tradition, consisting of about 1,532 octosyllabic verses in rhyming couplets.8 Another distinct feature of Version T is the shift in focus from the holy man Zozimas to Mary the Egyptian herself. Other language traditions — such the Old English, which is considered the earliest Western vernacular redaction (Magennis,* Old English Life* 1) — concentrate largely on Zozimas’s humble ventures. In the introduction to his edition, Hugh Magennis writes:\n\n…the Old English Life of St. Mary of Egypt betrays no indications of anxiety or reticence in transmitting the saint’s sense of her own sinfulness or in detailing the extent of that sinfulness, nor does it seek to downplay the gender issues that are inherent in the received legend, in which Mary, a woman, is presented as a figure of authority and a teacher to Zosimas, while he, though a priest, defers to her spiritual superiority. The Life of St Mary of Egypt portrays a spiritually-empowered female, who has lived independent of the guidance of men to an extent unparalleled elsewhere in Old English writings about saints. (2-3)\n\nThough I am not at all opposed to viewing Mary the Egyptian as a ‘spiritually-empowered female,’ I am somewhat skeptical of this characterization being equally applied to versions in which she is not even the central character of the narrative.9 Version T pulls Mary the Egyptian from the margins of her own legend and makes her the central protagonist. This major narrative shift was clearly an intentional, meaningful choice on the part of the T-poet, and it warrants more analysis than it has received.\nAlthough Version T has been described as the “apex of the legend’s development” by Duncan Robertson (Medieval Saints’ Lives 119), it has received relatively little scholarly attention in comparison to contemporary texts of other genres.10 A good number of pieces have been written addressing Rutebeuf’s later French version (Version R) of the saint’s legend,11 but Peter Dembowski, who does not include R in his edition, portrays R as merely a reshuffling of T with some two hundred verses inserted from Version O (Marie L’Égyptienne 22-23).12 We might suspect that Version R’s relative popularity among modern scholars stems in part from the fact that we can attach the name of Rutebeuf to the text, reading the narrative through the self-acknowledged intentions of that known author who embeds himself within it,13 but also, thanks to the work of Michel Zink, Version R is the only French version of the Life of Mary the Egyptian that has been published in translation, making it far more accessible to modern readers. Similarly, a great deal of scholarship has been produced focusing on the Old English verse redaction, and we might draw some connection between this scholarly interest and the availability of the Old English poem thanks to the Magennis edition, which includes a modern English parallel-text translation.14 A great deal of scholarship has been published addressing the legend in the many other vernacular languages as well,15 especially the Spanish tradition, which is itself believed to make use of Version T as its source.16 There are only a handful, though, of articles and chapters that focus wholly and directly on T.17 These include editor of Version T Peter Dembowski’s discussion of the poem’s use of Anglo-Norman language;18 five pieces written by Duncan Robertson over several decades primarily concerned with the way the T-poet is able to render the Life into vernacular verse without sacrificing its spiritual core;19 a section of a chapter on gender in hagiography by Simon Gaunt in his monograph Gender and Genre in Medieval French Literature (1995);20 Cary Howie’s article addressing the relationship between the visibility of saintly bodies and notions of conversion;21 and portions of Emma Campbell’s Medieval Saints’ Lives: The Gift, Kinship and Community in Old French Hagiography (2008).22 These scholars of Version T have come to somewhat differing conclusions about the text, but overall, there has been a unified fixation on Mary the Egyptian’s sexuality as the key to understanding her legend.\nRobertson considers the translation of the saint’s Life into the French vernacular a signal of a renewal of interest in her Life. He points to the period as one in which the act of reading became particularly pertinent to spirituality, in which there was an upsurge in Marian devotion, and in which hagiography was influenced by “poets and romancers” (“Poem and Spirit” 306) to suit the tastes of a lay audience. He insists that the text is not a vulgarization of the saint’s Life; rather the poet demonstrates a clear sense of orthodoxy (“Poem and Spirit” 316). For Robertson, the content and rhetoric of the text when combined become a “manifestation of Grace” (“Poem and Spirit” 319), exemplifying the paradoxical nature of Mary the Egyptian as a holy sinner. She invokes the Virgin, who “is not merely a person but an incarnate formal principle, the universal reconciliation of contraries — nothing more and nothing less than poetry itself” (“Poem and Spirit” 318). His assessment, however, is not shared by Simon Gaunt who emphasizes the sexual pleasure the text may have been intended to arouse in a male audience at the expense of women:\n\nThe men reading this text can enjoy both the titillating spectacle of the adventures of the comely and sexy harlot, and then the physical degradation of that very same body as it is punished, largely for the desire it aroused in them. The text appeals to the libido of the men in the audience by playing on the desire of the male characters for Marie and by offering an erotic description of her body, but it then enables them to feel morally uplifted by the tale and in so doing it parallels the sadism of virgin-martyr narratives. The implied male audience has its cake and eats it: it watches a holy strip show in which the stripper is first allowed to do her act, and is then punished for her lack of shame, allowing the male audience to enjoy the show, then to feel righteous. The popularity of the legend of Marie l’Egyptienne is no doubt due to more than the medieval reader’s taste for narratives about repentance. (219)\n\nIn response to this quite provocative framing of the narrative and Gaunt’s otherwise dismissive characterization of female saints’ Lives, Robertson counters the view that hagiography largely demonizes and punishes women with a more nuanced stance on the genre:\n\nSaintly women are a much more varied lot than Gaunt’s commentary might lead one to suppose. And their vocational chastity can take on a variety of individual meanings. … These women are all autonomous, active figures — not victims or objects but subjects of religious experiences, who invoke the reader’s interest, concern, sympathy, admiration, empathy, and eventual imitation. (“‘Cume lur cumpaine et lur veisine’” 15-16)\n\nRobertson’s vision for Anglo-Norman hagiography invites us to read the Life of Mary the Egyptian — and in particular Version T of the Vie — as a text meant to draw in a mixed audience of men and women and clerics and lay people alike.23 The audience — either reading or hearing the verses of the T-poet — is given permission to comfortably identify with Mary the Egyptian as both sinner and saint through both an intellectual and emotional arousal, and in identifying with this complex, powerful figure, the audience may further identify with the Virgin and Christ himself.\nGaunt’s reading has also been addressed directly by both Howie and Campbell who, like Robertson, take interest in the eroticism of T and come to somewhat different conclusions. In his article, Howie cites the above description from Gaunt, but he instead argues that Gaunt, “… only addresses half of the text’s erotic charge. I would argue that the strip show, in Marie’s life, does not stop at her conversion. As this encounter with Zosimas more than amply suggests, the text’s scandal is that of an eroticized penitent body” (324; Howie’s emphasis). For Howie, T is a challenging, masterful text because it is recognizably erotic throughout the entire narrative, not only when Mary is in the throes of her former mestier but also in the midst of her asceticism. Far more important than the sexual desire that her body excites is the religious desire she likewise provokes. Howie notes the throughline running from her public prostitution to her private asceticism, writing, “It is not just that Mary arouses the desire of her viewer; she arouses the desire to see, a desire for visual plenitude which will only ever be frustrated and enticed by her constant turnings, between enclosure and exposure, between part and whole” (331). Howie helpfully complicates Gaunt’s reading by extending desire to include Mary in her penitent form, but I do find Howie’s analysis to fixate somewhat too much on Mary’s genitals,24 and in both Gaunt and Howie, we can see a scholarly conversation that approaches the Life of Mary the Egyptian from a mostly heteronormative bias that assumes a male reader’s desire for the female body.\nBuilding on Gaunt and Howie, Campbell leverages the wider corpus of the French tradition of Mary the Egyptian to queer our reading of Mary’s body and the discourse surrounding her body, demonstrating the indeterminacy of both the messages of this text and the audiences of this text — audiences who, according to Campbell, formed a larger, complex community.25 Campbell sees Mary’s nakedness before Zosimas’s gaze as mirroring the “verbal striptease” (162) of her confessions,26 and she considers this scene of their initial meeting to remain “residually attached to the titillation that this relationship was originally designed to produce” (162) — meaning a desire for salvation above all else through humility. But much like Robertson, Campbell also reframes Mary the Egyptian’s relationship with her audience in a compelling way:\n\nMary’s redefined relationship to the social world is one that involves the confirmation of male community rather than its dissolution, the setting of Christian example rather than its corruption. It is a relationship that once again exposes Mary to a male public, yet in a transformed, strictly disembodied form: the final contact between Mary and her male admirers is ultimately maintained not through her body but through the text of her life. (164; my emphasis)\n\nWhen Zozimas discovers the deceased body of Mary the Egyptian — identified for him clearly for the first time thanks to the miraculous note left beside her corpse that reads, “Zozimas, take the body of Mary, / and bury it with God’s help. / When you have buried it, / pray for her by your mercy” (vv.1387-1390)27 —, the reader is simultaneously struck in parallel by this experience of revelation, reading the miraculous note through Zozimas’s eyes.28 Exposed to the reader thanks to the language of the T-poet, Mary the Egyptian is transmuted; her being has been made interpretable in textual form as a readable corpus in contrast with her former body, which at one time was ‘knowable’ only sexually. Following her burial, Zozimas is ready to unveil her story to others:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZosimas conmence a parler,\nZosimas begins to speak,\n\n\n\n\nIl ne se volra mais celer.\nHe does not want to conceal\n\n\nDe l‘Egyptiene Marie\nMary the Egyptian:\n\n\nLor raconte toute le vie,\nHe tells them her whole life (vv.1501-1504)\n\n\n\n\nThis conclusion sets off a mise en abyme of storytelling: Zozimas is finally free to tell Mary the Egyptian’s story to his brotherhood who will, in turn, improve the lives of others in the retelling of it; the anonymous T-poet has recounted the narrative to the reader who will likewise feel compelled to share the narrative of Zozimas telling the story of Mary the Egyptian who — prior to all of this — has told* her story* to Zozimas. As the reader recognizes him or herself as a member of this knowledge loop, they encounter the complicated layers embedded within Version T. That layering not only invites repeated telling and retelling but also exemplifies the dynamic interaction between text, interpretation, and transmission.\nSuch a structure makes Version T an all the more ideal candidate for an experimental edition that leverages the nuances of its textual variations across its manuscript witnesses. The close consideration of individual manuscript copies further complicates our understanding of Version T and may even help to explain how this narrative has been received so contrastingly by previous scholars. Over the course of the scholarly conversation outlined above, we can see a shared fascination with the eroticism of T, but something somewhat lacking from this decades-long dialogue is a more explicit regard for the individual source manuscripts and their influence.\nAlthough Gaunt, Howie, and Campbell are all engaging with overlapping source material — Gaunt, Howie, and Campbell all make some use of Dembowski’s edition of T, and Gaunt and Campbell each explore Version R through separate editions.29 — each of these scholars is relying on a slightly different group of texts (different editions and manuscript copies) to inform their analyses, which could be one source of the differences in their readings. The base text of Dembowski’s edition of T is Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) MS Français 23112 also known as copy A, or T-A. Gaunt uses Dembowski’s Versions T and O (326n51), and Howie uses Dembowski’s T (322n13), so they are both effectively using Manuscript A. But while Gaunt explores multiple versions of the text for the sake of demonstrating his general view of hagiography as fundamentally misogynist,30 Howie’s more narrow focus on Version T (which he places in conversation with La Vie de saint Jehan Bouche d’Or) ultimately brings him to see the body of our saint as ever shimmering on the threshold of visibility, defying fixity.31 Campbell brings an added layer of precision to her queer reading, specifying her use especially of Oxford Bodleian Library MS Canonici Misc. 74 (copy T-B),32 but also the Manchester John Rylands University Library MS French 6 fragment (copy T-F¹), and Paris BnF MS Français 19525 (copy T-D) in her discussions of Version T.33 These scholars are all basing their analyses on different copies of T (or adding in another version of the legend for consideration), and so, are formulating variant conclusions about the figure of Mary using different source material. When we are literally not on the same page of parchment, we are at risk of talking past one another.",

    "text": "Cross-Copy Reading & The Difference It Makes\nPaying attention to the different manuscripts of T, — with the many alterations in details that they include, elide, and emphasize — allows us to build upon current readings of the French Mary the Egyptian, of her body, her beauty, and her holiness. While much of the existing scholarship on Version T relies on Dembowski’s edition, — and thus largely relies on Manuscript A (Paris BnF MS fr. 23112) — this dissertation seeks to enrich the present conversation by engaging more comprehensively with the array of manuscript copies available. The exploration of Version T in this dissertation aims not just to add another voice to the existing scholarship but to reshape the present conversation by foregrounding a greater level of scrutiny to the text across its manuscript witnesses. In doing so, I seek to open up new avenues for reading Mary with fresh eyes. By thoroughly examining the full body of textual evidence available, we may enjoy an increased level of confidence and clarity in our scholarly conclusions.\nTo provide a clear example of the benefit of cross-copy reading and the difference it makes in our analyses, I turn to the work of Élisabeth Pinto-Mathieu. In her comparative analysis of the Lives of Mary the Egyptian, Mary Magdalene, and Thaïs, Pinto-Mathieu highlights the challenge of navigating the diverse and evolving hagiographic traditions across languages and centuries.34 Pinto-Mathieu seeks textual stability in her article by centering the Legenda aurea, arguing that vernacular versions of hagiographic texts tend to be “pures traductions d’une tradition latine souvent plus érudite” (90) anyway, but she does at various points also make use of the many French versions of the Mary the Egyptian Vie, including in particular Version T. In the article, Pinto-Mathieu does mention two specific manuscripts of Version T — BnF MS fr. 23112, or T-A, and MS Canonici Misc. 74, or T-B (100n15&16) — but these copies are only referenced specifically in order to indicate T’s placement chronologically in the broader French tradition so that Pinto-Mathieu might use Version T to explore a feature entirely absent from the Latin tradition: the portraits of Mary the Egyptian — one describing her body during her sexually promiscuous phase and one describing her body as an ascetic in the desert.\nPinto-Mathieu makes the argument that Mary’s body (in Version T) is initially beautiful and desirable and sensual and later becomes ugly, frightening, and generally husk-like as a result of her harsh penance — an argument that is commonly repeated in work on Mary the Egyptian, and even specifically in Version T scholarship, without much variation.35 She suggests that the presence of the first portrait depicting Mary’s initial beauty is only added by the T-poet so that her later more mysterious figure might appear all the more shocking for the reader: “Le portrait physique ne s’imprègne de la poésie courtoise et érotique à la mode que par jeu littéraire, pour préfigurer un second portrait, celui de la noirceur saisissante” (101).36 In support of this argument, she writes that one need only look to a single detail within the portraits to understand the function of these portraits: Mary the Egyptian’s breasts. She points to the use of the word mameles (v.177) in the first portrait and the use of the word traians (v.643) in the second, suggesting the former is far more sensual than the latter. She writes, “Les ‘mameles,’ terme consacré de l’érotique courtoise, se réduisent à la fonction de ‘traians’; elles ne relèvent plus que de l’anatomie” (103n19). She is suggesting that Mary the Egyptian was once sensual and becomes merely physical, and is certainly physically undesirable, having shed the erotic function of this part of her body. Regardless of which version of the legend one reads — according to Pinto-Mathieu — the message is uncomplicatedly the same: “Qu’elle gomme le portrait, comme le fera Jacques de Voragine, ou bien qu’elle en joue, le travaille et l’exhibe par des procédés d’écriture spéculaire, l’hagiographie des pécheresses repenties du XIIIe siècle n’aspire qu’à prôner le renoncement à la chair” (103).\nIn fact, if we consider the verses describing Mary the Egyptian’s breasts across the extant manuscript copies, the word mameles is only used in manuscripts T-A and T-B, and manuscript T-B omits the verse that would use traians in the second portrait entirely, whereas every other whole copy — the fragments are, unfortunately, missing these passages of the text— uses the term traians for both portraits.\n\nT-A: “Les mameles de cele dame” (v.177) → “N’avoit plus char en ses traians” (v.643)\nT-B: “& si avoit beles mameles” (v.171) → [verse omitted in B]\nT-C: “Chascun des traianz la dame” (v.179) → “N’avoit plus char en sa traiant” (v.655)\nT-D: “Chascun des traianz a la dume” (v.175) → “N’aveit plus char en sun traiant” (v.645)\nT-E: “L’un des traians de cele dome” (v.178) → “N’avoit de char en ses traians” (v.645)\nT-L: “Cacune traiant de la dome” → “N’avoit plus char en son traiant”37\nT-F1: [offers only the first 10.5 verses of Portrait 1]\nT-F2: [both portraits missing]\n\nWhen reading across the T corpus, instead of relying solely on one manuscript copy, we can see that this particular argument of Mary’s supposedly degraded beauty may be called into question. How valid is it to say that the once erotic, sensual, sinful Mary the Egyptian is no longer desirable, or even touchable, in her more purified ascetic form if we find a consistent use of traians regardless of Mary’s state of being? The difference of a single word in a single manuscript may seem significant, but when examined more closely, it can reveal how seemingly stable arguments rely on faulty evidence.\nI might just as easily draw a completely contrasting conclusion regarding Mary’s sensuality using the evidence of a single word found only in a single manuscript copy of T. If I were to base my reading solely on manuscript T-C, for example, I could — by the same method — come to the conclusion that Mary’s initial form is one that is hard and threatening while her ascetic form is soft and inviting. In manuscript T-C, Mary the Egyptian is compared to a precious stone in the first portrait — a gemme38 — a descriptor not found in any of the other Version T manuscript copies. A gem is a precious thing, but it is also a hard, unliving stone, an object that men might kill one another to possess — as Mary’s many lovers in fact do— suggesting that during her sexual career, Mary exists in an objectified, lifeless state; she is beautiful but cold, unfeeling, and unapproachable. In contrast, while living spiritually in the desert, Mary is, according to every single manuscript copy, mossue, sometimes even in multiple lines,39 which may be interpreted in this context as “mossy,” “fuzzy,” “shaggy,” “bushy,” “wooly,” “furry,” or simply “hairy.” Thus, in the second portrait, Mary is undeniably pilose, perhaps even invitingly touchable. In light of this evidence, which of these Marys — the sinner or the saint — is more approachable? And what might this shift in perspective tell us about her legend and the wide array of people who encountered it? A single word in a single verse of a single manuscript may justify the raising of a question, but it will rarely provide sufficient footing for a confident interpretive claim. However, the sum total of hundreds of such pieces of textual evidence gathered across the full corpus of extant manuscripts will offer a far more stable and persuasive foundation for an argument.\nAs I will discuss at greater length in Chapter 1, typically, the purpose of an edition is to provide readers with a tidied up version of a text — to provide the sort of seemingly stable homogeneity Pinto-Mathieu describes seeking in her article —, but this process of tidying can conceal the meaningful ‘clutter’ present in the many source manuscripts, leading to potential misrepresentations of existing material evidence in favor of a more digestible text abstracted from the manuscript record.40 In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I offer digital editions of the two T portraits from each of the available manuscript copies with unique English translations for each copy; these editions and translations serve as the basis for the cross-copy close reading of the portraits performed in Chapter 3. Making these edited and translated portraits more readily available is also intended to invite my readers to approach the arguments I make in this dissertation with greater scrutiny as I believe reading across the full T corpus will lead to stronger arguments and more open, complex scholarly conversations. Pinto-Mathieu’s approach retains value in that articles like hers laid the groundwork in the late 1990s for giving literary attention to medieval texts written about — and possibly written by and for — women, and in particular for giving literary attention to hagiographical texts. But now that we have more tools — digitization and digital editing — to create editions that offer more in the way of visualizing and untangling the manuscript copies, future scholarship will be able to make greater use of the nuances of manuscript traditions and produce more solid, careful readings.",

    "section": "Why a Digital Edition of Version T?",
    "text": "Why a Digital Edition of Version T?\nAt the conclusion of Éloge de la variante (1989), Cerquiglini recognizes the worthy efforts of recent editors — naming Peter Dembowski’s La Vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne among others (112)41 — to push the limits of print to convey manuscript variance. Characterizing such print editions as “Tentatives sympathiques, fort utiles, qui traduisent un besoin, mais laissent insatisfait” (112), Cerquiglini insists, “La solution est ailleurs” (112); the solution — for Cerquiglini — lies with the then quite recent progress of the computer screen. Cerquiglini excitedly praises the computer’s potential to provide readers with far more data than one might reasonably set down in print without ruining the reading experience, but more profoundly, he sees the most novel technical contribution of the computer to be its potential to reconnect modern readers intellectually and emotionally to a medieval understanding of texts and their movement:\n\nCar l’ordinateur, par son écran dialogique et multidimensionnel, simule la mobilité incessante et joyeuse de l’écriture médiévale, comme il restitue la prodigieuse faculté de mémoire de son lecteur, mémoire qui définit sa réception esthétique, fonde le plaisir qu’il y prend. (114-115)\n\nRather than conceptualizing Version T as a singular ‘text,’ we might helpfully enrich our reading experience and our scholarship by engaging with the fact that Version T survives in eight distinct, yet interrelated, manuscripts (six complete copies and two fragments).42 We might highlight the nuances presented by each manuscript that would typically remain obscured through the medium of a traditional print edition.43 And I am not alone in thinking that Version T, in particular, merits a new edition — one that does more to render individual copies and their correlations plainly visible for the reader.\nDuncan Robertson, himself, put out the call for a new edition of T in his 1998 study “The Anglo-Norman Verse Life of St. Mary the Egyptian,” in which he offers a systematic study of all the extant T manuscripts, providing a valuable update to Dembowski’s previous work.44 In this article, Robertson proposes a roadmap to future editors for how best to approach a new edition of Version T in a way that offers improved visualizations of the full corpus of manuscript transcriptions to facilitate a more complex reading without excessively burdening the reader, writing, “Ideally, the reader should be spared the painful task of reconstituting them from lists of variants” (“The Anglo-Norman Verse Life” 41) — a clear critique of the traditional method of noting variants as paratextual material to be deciphered by only the most attentive of readers, which we see in most print editions, including Dembowski’s.45 Robertson, of course, praises Dembowski’s edition — an edition that remains an invaluable resource for scholars of the French Mary the Egyptian tradition —, but he makes its limitations clear:\n\nThe problem is that in passage after passage, the A text blurs the sense and muffles the expressive rhetoric of the poem. It does so, moreover, in the course of a normalizing, Picardizing campaign, which effectively severs the poem’s textual connection to the Anglo-Norman manuscript tradition (still present in A’s immediate source), and thereby removes it from the literary affinities that constitute its true native milieu. (“The Anglo-Norman Verse Life” 41)\n\nEvidently relying exclusively on a single manuscript witness is too restrictive, which might lead some to favor the composite editing method in which multiple copies are assembled by the editor to make a sort of Franken-edition — or perhaps an attempt is made to reconstruct the ‘Original’ text —, but Robertson likewise denounces this method, “Not only would such a construction have no documentary validity, but also it would falsify the inherent plurality of this textual tradition” (“The Anglo-Norman Verse Life” 40). If a composite edition will not do, then editors are left, once again, with selecting a particular manuscript to serve as the base text or editing a limited number of copies in parallel. While practical, considering the restrictions of the print medium, selecting a single copy, or even a few copies, fails to represent the poem comprehensively.46 How, then, can we offer the plenitude of the Version T corpus to readers while acknowledging the fact that a reader can only read one line at a time?\nTo overcome these challenges, the method Robertson proposes is an “editorial grid” system in which the text is presented with some of its variants laid out in parallel on the page, selectively highlighting apparent differences in repetition, rhyme, and sequence — three characteristics Robertson identifies as being particularly meaningful attributes of the T poem (“The Anglo-Norman Verse Life” 31). Roberson’s solution would allow the editor to make key moments of variance much clearer, but at the time he proposed it, the physical limitations of print still meant that such an edition would not allow for fully edited comparable transcriptions of all eight manuscript copies to be laid out together for the reader, and the reader would still be reliant on the editor’s judgement in selecting which moments of the text are worthy of a more attentive reading across the copies.\nDespite Cerquiglini’s great enthusiasm for the potential of computers to resolve all of our editorial needs in the late 1980s, the adoption of digital methods in premodern textual editing has been slow to take hold. Robertson’s call for a new edition appeared at the cusp of the wider digital turn of the late 1990s at which time digital methods were not nearly as accessible to individual humanities scholars as they are now in the 2020s, and so, Robertson did not entertain the possibility of a digital edition, but I would argue that his proposal is essentially a proto-digital edition whose scale has been reduced to meet the physical constraints of the printed page. The present digital edition has been greatly informed by Robertson’s recommendations for a more selective depiction of textual variance,47 but my ambition for this digital edition is to do what was not nearly as possible — but was clearly desired — only a few decades ago: provide full edited transcriptions of every T manuscript, which the reader may find in Appendix 2 of this dissertation, and eventually, full English translations of every copy — an ambition I will pursue beyond the scope of this dissertation.48\nIn agreement with Cerquiglini and Robertson, I believe there is a great necessity to take a closer look at Version T, not as a singular text, but rather as a group of texts existing simultaneously in the eight extant manuscript copies that we have of T. The Life of Mary the Egyptian of Version T is not fully conveyed in any one copy or another, but in all of them at once. Strengthening our relationship with the source manuscripts of Version T forces us to reevaluate the way we think about Mary the Egyptian and the broader implications of her legend. By offering access to Version T as a corpus of variant texts and material contexts, this edition invites readers to experience what John Bryant calls a ‘fluid-text moment’ or the jarring realization of textual instability that challenges and enriches our understanding of medieval literature.49 I am not arguing, however, that it is the responsibility of every single medievalist to track down and personally consult every single manuscript copy of any text they ever work on. We cannot all be Christopher de Hamel, globe-trotting around with direct access to the most precious manuscripts in the world.50 Rather, I believe more can reasonably be done to reform the way we edit and disseminate medieval texts through the application of digital methods that facilitate clearer visualizations of texts and their traditions, grounded in their manuscript witnesses. Advancements in our editing practices will improve the quality of our scholarship by pushing us to be more meticulously evidence-based in our analyses, and expanding the accessibility of medieval texts through open-access editions and translations will equip us with the tools we need to reach modern readers where they are. By addressing the complexities and specificities of the manuscript tradition of Version T, this dissertation not only responds to Robertson’s specific call for a new editorial approach but also pushes the boundaries of how medieval French texts are presently edited and understood in the digital age, inspired by Cerquiglini’s hope for a new édition écranique. The result is an edition that respects the inherent plurality of the work and provides a foundation for future scholarship to build upon, ensuring that the unique voices of the manuscripts are preserved and appreciated in their full historical and literary value.",

    "text": "Structure\nChapter 1, “On Digital Editing,” lays the theoretical foundation for the project by critically evaluating the way in which scholars currently discover, search for, study, edit, and share lesser known medieval texts, offering a brief case study of the now-lost manuscript fragment of Version T of La Vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne known as T-F2. While digitization has made strides, there is still significant room for improvement in accessibility and preservation through digital methods like digital editing, with editions serving as supplemental resources for better accessing and understanding the material manuscripts as well as the texts they contain. Examining the limitations of traditional print critical editions, Chapter 1 advocates for digital editing grounded in material manuscript sources in alignment with the New Philology movement. Addressing common counterarguments to digital methods, this chapter proposes approaches to enhance scholarly visualization and engagement with pre-modern texts.\nDivided into two parts, Chapter 2 “An Approach to Editing Version T,” outlines the development and execution of the digital edition begun in this dissertation — a digital edition that renders both editorial intervention and the variance among manuscript copies more readable and thus more informative for scholarly interpretation. Part 1 of Chapter 2 details the process of transcribing, editing, and encoding all the available manuscript copies of Version T — material provided in Appendix 2 of this dissertation. This part introduces a novel multi-column format for the digital edition, which displays the text at various levels of editorial intervention, ranging from ‘Nearly Diplomatic’ to ‘Extensive.’ This presentation style makes plain the mediating hand of the editor and encourages readers to consider editions to be active reinterpretations of original texts, rather than mere reproductions. Part 2 offers a digital edition of the two portraits of Mary the Egyptian found in Version T with English translations of each extant copy. By narrowing in on the portraits alone, this part provides a more targeted case study for what is possible when further visualization methods are applied, demonstrating the potential of digital editions to make plain the textual variance present across manuscript copies in a more legible format than one might find in a traditional print edition. The presentation of these portraits is designed to facilitate reading across the manuscript copies and supports the analysis performed in Chapter 3. Additionally, the availability of these portraits in translation further promotes the accessibility of this text to a wider reading audience.\nChapter 3, “A Cross-Copy Close Reading,” demonstrates the critical value of conducting a literary analysis across the different manuscript copies of Version T, specifically through a detailed examination of the text’s two portraits of Mary the Egyptian. By tracing both the continuity and variance of poetic elements such as negation, color imagery, and metaphor across the manuscripts, this close reading enriches existing interpretations of Mary, particularly regarding the controversial nature of her desirability and the theological function of her Vie.\nFollowing the conclusion to this dissertation, which addresses some of the unresolved challenges raised by the work, Appendix 1, “The Manuscripts,” provides a comprehensive examination of the manuscript corpus preserving Version T. Drawing on my direct observations of all accessible manuscripts, as well as catalog records, digitizations and microfilm reproductions, and other foundational scholarship such as Peter Dembowski’s edition, I consolidate the available scattered metadata and offer detailed commentary on the location, condition, and accessibility of these eight known copies, including the two fragments. By briefly addressing the challenges of manuscript access — including personal experiences with the recent disruptions at the British Library — this study underscores the importance of supplemental resources for advancing scholarship. By bringing together this information in a single resource, this appendix not only aids researchers facing barriers to direct access but also highlights new avenues for future investigation into the material and textual history of Version T.\nThe final component of this dissertation — Appendix 2, “Edited Transcriptions” —, is an experimental digital edition in which interested readers may explore the entirety of the extant Version T corpus. The format of Appendix 2 seeks to explicitly show readers the mediating hand of the editor in rendering the contents of these eight manuscripts for a modern audience by presenting each T copy with varying levels of editorial intervention, which may be freely navigated by the reader as desired. The inclusion of this appendix is meant to demonstrate to readers the extensive work that has already been done in transcribing and editing the full T corpus, while also acknowledging what remains to be done, namely additional revision and full English translations of every manuscript copy. Where available, links to the digital facsimiles of several T manuscripts (T-A, T-D, T-E, T-F1, and T-F2) are provided, but future iterations of this project would ideally seek to integrate these digitizations more fully with the aim of further bridging the gap between the medieval source and the modern reader. Together, Chapters 1 and 2 and Appendix 2 articulate a vision of editorial work that is rigorous, continuous, and transparent.\nFinally, as the entirety of this dissertation is presented as a digital document authored using the publishing system Quarto — a new open-source publishing system made by developers of the programming language R —, readers may see how the very format of this dissertation is in alignment with its arguments. By adopting a digital format that facilitates the integration of static and dynamic content, this dissertation embodies the push for more digitally forward editions and scholarship and reflects a commitment to leveraging contemporary technology to enhance the accessibility, visualization, and interpretation of medieval texts.",

Uppsala Special Collections Archivist Ina-Maria Jansson did, however, supply me with Rankka’s obituary, which describes Rankka’s commitment to editing and translating works of medieval French literature into Swedish through the later years of his life (personal correspondence via email 8-13 Aug 2024).↩︎\n It is possible that Rankka was supplied with this same handlist, but he does not include it in the bibliography of his edition.↩︎\n “Mais malement fu enseignie” (v.60). Unless otherwise stated, all verses in this dissertation will be cited in reference to manuscript copy T-A (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Français 23112), which is the base text of Peter Dembowski’s edition of Version T in La Vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne: Versions en ancien et en moyen français (1977). &gt; The term ‘verse’ is used in this dissertation to refer to the the single metrical unit of poetry, and ‘line’ refers to a single row of text copied within a manuscript. All translations, unless otherwise stated, are my own.↩︎\n “D’erbe vesqui & de rachines / Xvii. ans. par les gastines / Puis fu .xxx. ans onc ne manga / Se angeles ne li aporta” // “On grass she lived and on roots / for seventeen years in the wilderness. / Then for thirty years, she ate nothing / unless an angel brought it to her.” (vv.681-684)↩︎\n “Ne ainc en trestot le boscaige / Ne li vint puis beste salvaige / Ne autre vive creature / Par le gaut va toute seure” // “Never in all the wood / did any wild beast come to her thereafter / nor any other living creature. / Through the forest, she goes completely safe.” (vv.695-698)↩︎\n Version T is one of about a dozen versions in the French tradition alone. The other versions — as described by Dembowski — are X, V, W, N, O, O1, Z, U, Y, L1, L2, L3, and R. Version T is considered one of the earliest of these, dating at least to the late twelfth century according to Alfred T. Baker and confirmed by Dembowski (17). Version X was believed by &gt; Hermann Knust to be the source for T, but Paul Meyer correctly judged — according to Dembowski (17) — the inverse to be the case. Dembowski suggests X was likely written soon after T though probably near start of the thirteenth century (17). Version V, dating to the fifteenth century, likely derives from X as Dembowski notes the two share the unique accusation of incest as being among Mary the Egyptian’s many sins (18). Dembowski dates Version W — a short Anglo-Norman poem likely translated from a Latin source — to the end of the twelfth century, making it a rough contemporary of Version T (18). Dembowski repeats Hilding&gt; Kjellman’s assessment that Version N likely dates to somewhere between 1230 and 1250 based on a linguistic study of the collection of miracles of the Virgin in which N is included (19). Dembowski says that the N poet was likely following a Latin prose source, but he cannot exclude the possibility that the N poet had access to Version T too due to some resemblance between some of their verses (18-19). Version O is the translation of an unidentified Latin version of Sophronius and the primary source of Version R (19). Based on the linguistic evidence, Dembowski would not date Version O any later than 1250. Version O&gt; 1&gt; is a significantly abridged redaction of Version O, which Dembowski chose to feature separately “de ne pas trop encombrer l’appareil critique et ne pas le rendre à peu inutilisable” (20). According to Dembowski, Version Z is contemporary with O but was likely the translation of a simpler, more concise Latin text (20). Version U is of a similar type to O and Z — though less than half the length of O —, dating to the second half of the thirteenth century (20-21). Version Y is about a third of the length of Version O and dates to the mid-fifteenth century (21). Finally, L&gt; 1&gt; , L&gt; 2&gt; , and L&gt; 3&gt; are French translations of the &gt; Golden Legend&gt; of Jacobus de Voragine (21) with L&gt; 1&gt; dating to the end of the thirteenth century (263), L&gt; 2&gt; to the second quarter of the fourteenth century (269), and L&gt; 3&gt; anterior to the fifteenth century (275).↩︎\n Other than Version R, which is of comparable length but is a derivative of T, Version W, which is made up of only 140 lines, and Version N, which consists of 407 lines, all of the other surviving versions in the French tradition are written in prose.↩︎\n The French versions that are narratively centered on Mary are T, X, V, W, N, and R — all of these apparently deriving structurally from T —, and the versions that are narratively centered on her counterpart Zosimas are O, Z, U, Y, and L.↩︎\n Simon Gaunt makes it clear that the discrepancy between texts that were most popular among medieval readers and those that are most popular among modern readers is in large part caused by the skewed production of modern editions: “Hagiography is good for medievalists. I do not thereby mean that the texts are necessarily good for their souls (though they may be), but rather that saints’ lives offer a useful corrective to the reading experience of most modern readers of vernacular medieval literature, which is often grounded almost entirely in profane texts. … The profane texts students of Old French and Occitan mostly read represent a tiny proportion of the texts produced in medieval France and Occitania. Even in the vernacular the quantity of religious texts which has survived is far greater than their availability in modern editions suggests and vernacular hagiography was at least as popular as other literary genres, if not more so. Modern views of medieval vernacular writing are skewed by the marginalization of hagiography” (180).↩︎\n These include &gt; Dawson (2003) & (2005),&gt; Delfin (1989), Foehr-Janssens (2000), Karras (1990), Mariani (2017), Nash (1971), and &gt; Uhlig (2010).↩︎\n In her article “Rutebeuf’s Contribution to the Saint Mary the Egyptian Legend” (1971), Suzanne Nash likewise describes R as a simplification of T, “The prayer in T  is far more complicated. Not only does it reveal a feminine mind analysing her own sinfulness, but it is atour de force  of persuasive rhetoric” (699n12; Nash’s emphasis). According to Nash’s assessment, the verse of R relies more heavily on poetic devices of repetition to imitate the kinetic experience of Catholic ritual in order to excite a lay audience that “was not especially learned” (697). Thus, Nash supposes that the audience’s experience of R* * becomes more ritualistic than didactic (697). If we follow Nash’s assessment that T is far more literarily complex and didactic than R, then who exactly was the intended readership of T? And what exactly were they meant to glean from its highbrow style and its elevated didacticism? Scholars of Version T have come to somewhat differing conclusions to these questions, which I will discuss further below, but overall, scholarship on T has been predominantly fixated on Mary the Egyptian’s sexuality as the key to approaching the answers.↩︎\n Emma Campbell recounts how Rutebeuf describes the labor of his rewriting of the saint’s Vie as an act of penance in imitation of Mary’s own labors (176).↩︎\n An English translation of Paul the Deacon’s Latin Life of Saint Mary of Egypt was also published by Benedicta Ward in her Harlots of the Desert: A Study of Repentance in Early Monastic Sources (1987), which may have also contributed to the quantity of English language scholarship on the legend in general. The essay collection* The Legend of Mary of Egypt in Medieval Insular Hagiography* (1996) and several other pieces (Chase [1986], Heron [2000], Karras [1996], Lees & Overing [2001] Magennis [1985], and Scheil [2000]) on the topic of the insular tradition predate the Magennis edition, but appearing after the Magennis edition, we have seven more articles concerning the Old English verse: Black (2011) & (2017), Blud (2017), Cotter-Lynch (2021), Maslanka (2013), Szarmach (2013), and Watt & Lees (2011).↩︎\n By my count, 35 articles have been published concerning the Mary the Egyptian legend in the Bulgarian, Croatian, Dutch, German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Norse, and Spanish traditions. These include Acquafredda (2008), Beresford (2020), Bisanti (2013), Cortina (1980), Delmas (1900) & (1901), De Vleeschauwer (1998), Di Giorgi (2000), Dimitrova (1995), Eidinow (2019), Faccon (1998), Francomano (2014), Grieve (2000), Kaltsogianni (2011), Kersten (1992), Maier (1984), Miller (2003), Mirachvili-Springer (2012), Noret (1987), Ó Laoghaire (1990), Petrova (1999), Petrović (2005), Posa (1999), Scarborough (2013), Seidenspinner-Núñez (1992), Villani (1994), Walsh (1989), and eight more articles by Zubillaga alone.↩︎\n In the introduction to his edition, Dembowski writes “T a sûrement servi de source directe à d’autres versions vernaculaires (notamment à la prose X , au poème* R , à la paraphrase franco-vénitienne et à la Vida* espagnole)” (16).↩︎\n There are other publications that make use of Version T indirectly. As mentioned above, Nash (1971), Uhlig (2010), and Mariani (2017) are primarily fixated on Version R, but each of them do also make use of Version T for the sake of comparison. Uhlig, in particular, is admirably precise in specifying the exact verses from each version she uses to draw her conclusions, though she makes no reference to particular manuscripts, relying entirely on Dembowski’s edition. Cazelles (1979) discusses the French tradition of the legend more generally. She makes use of Versions T, W, N, O, and R to consider how these different versions render Mary the Egyptian a figure one might view as a model (or not) for “perfectionnement” (14). Ultimately, she does not believe the Life allows the reader to identify with Mary, writing, “Proche de Dieu et non du monde, Marie reste un mirage” (22). Karras’s hefty article “Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend” (1990) is similarly a more indirect treatment of Version T. She considers five different saints (Mary the Egyptian, Thaïs, Pelagia, Afra, and Mary Magdalene), and in her analysis of Mary the Egyptian, she makes use of Versions R and T while also making reference to the differences that may be found in other language traditions such as Latin, German, English, and Scottish. McCulloch (1982) makes use of Dembowski’s then recent edition to draw parallels between the T-poet’s portraits of Mary the Egyptian and Villon’s portraits of the Belle Heaulmière, which is her primary focus. Rudder (1982) focusses on Version X, claiming that because X is written in prose it reduces the stylistic elements present in T in favor of a greater emphasis on the deeper, religious teachings of the text — an analysis I do not support as Version T is considered the source of Version X and as T’s stylistic elements are what make its didactic messaging all the more powerful for instructing a lay audience. Pinto-Mathieu (1998) is mainly working from Jacobus de Voragine’s Golden Legend , finding a preference for redactions with a structural focus on Zozimas (106-107). Pinto-Mathieu does, however, make use of Dembowski’s edition of T to make certain points, which I will explore further below. Finally, Sargent’s research is fixated entirely on the development and influence of Version T, which she wholeheartedly endorses writing, “No other version of the* Life of St. Mary the Egyptian* advances beyond the development represented by T” (261). Sargent’s work is a dissertation — directed by Duncan Robertson — from the late 1970s, which does not appear to have resulted in any subsequent publications.↩︎\n “Le poème anonyme sur sainte Marie l’Égyptienne: Est-il anglo-norman?” (1981)↩︎\n In “Poem and Spirit” (1980), Robertson argues that the T-poet makes use of the rhetoric of the romance genre without vulgarizing it, taking clear inspiration from Bernard of Clairvaux, “For the French poet also the meaning of words is inseparable from feeling. … he has ‘translated’ the saint’s life into the barbarous language of love” (316). Then, in “Twelfth-Century Literary Experience” (1987), Robertson disagrees with Cazelles’s assessment that the reader cannot identify with Mary the Egyptian, claiming that Cazelles’s interpretation is more appropriate for the thirteenth-century versions, “But our 12th-century poem is another matter. It represents an exceptional moment in literary history, one of fervor and emotional immediacy. 12th-century saints’ lives present themselves insistently as experience, not other or alien, but very much our own” (77). Robertson’s monograph The Medieval Saints’ Lives(1995) and article “The Anglo-Norman Verse Life” (1998) are particularly useful in understanding Version T’s place in the larger history of the legend and within the genre of hagiography. Finally, “‘Cume lur cumpaine et lur veisine’” (2001) examines the complex fellowship among women in Anglo-Norman hagiography.↩︎\n Gaunt pays particular attention to Mary the Egyptian in the section “Clergie, Community and Gender” in the chapter “Saints, Sex, and Community: Hagiography” (212-233).↩︎\n “As the Saint Turns: Hagiography at the Threshold of the Visible” (2005)↩︎\n In particular, Campbell addresses Version T in the section titled “Queer Community in the Life of Mary the Egyptian: the T Version” (157-164) within the chapter “Queer Community” (149-178), which also includes some discussion of Version R (164-178).↩︎\n “They [women saints] propose to break the barriers that normally separate the human world from the divine, and also those that separate men from women, and clerics from laity. The women saints, in short, illustrate and confirm the writers’ faith in the text as a instrument capable of conveying the fullness of religious experience to auditors, who are included within it as fully qualified communicants. They speak to the readers, and pray with them, in their own language, in a poetic yet ‘neighborly’ discourse, stripped of the grammatical protocol, but ornamented with rhyme and rhetoric: an idiom in which female spirituality could be validated, and rendered anew” (“‘Cume lur cumpaine et lur veisine’” 23)↩︎\n Howie writes, “… it’s difficult to see anything other than Marie’s genitalia on display throughout the poem” (325). In Chapter 3 of this dissertation, I provide a close reading of the T portraits of Mary that departs from Howie’s emphasis on that one partie of her body, focusing instead on her hair, skin, feet, and breasts.↩︎\n Campbell finds that the genre of medieval saints’ Lives lends itself well to queer readings as these texts “provide a framework for communal identification that is never actualized within the text itself” (156). Pointing, for example, to the use of the ‘we’ pronoun evoked in the closing prayers associated with saints’ Lives and to the depiction of mass conversions commonly found in the Lives of martyrs, Campbell argues, “The narrative composition of such communities in saints’ lives therefore suggests a structure that permits — and possibly even invites — queer desires and identifications” (156).↩︎\n Howie also playfully nods toward Gaunt’s image of the strip show when discussing Zozimas’s discovery of Mary the Egyptian’s corpse, “The naked saint, before her death, only does a solo show” (328).↩︎\n “Zosimas pren le cors Marie / Sil ensevli o Dieu aie / Quant tu l’aras enseveli / Prie por li par te merchi” (vv.1387-1390).↩︎\n Campbell comments on this moment further, “…visual contemplation of the body becomes contemplation of divine text. Indeed, Mary is not just named by the divine escrit, she becomes it. … Rather than simply being discarded, the body is thus textualized in a way that resists more pessimistic and dualist assessments of the relationship between body and soul” (173). It is via this thread of Mary’s textual body that I would most like to enter the scholarly conversation with my own work, both in the production of this digital edition and through the analysis I offer of the T portraits in Chapter 3 of this dissertation.↩︎\n Gaunt uses Michel Zink’s edition of R, while Campbell uses the Bastin and Faral edition of R.↩︎\n “In examining various versions of Sainte Marie l’Égyptienne  I have taken an extreme example in order to illustrate my view that some saints’ lives are intended primarily for men and make no direct appeal to women. However, I suggested earlier in this chapter not only that hagiography was read by women, but also that one could speculate as to how it might have been received and used by some women. I see no reason why women should not have wanted to read narratives about repentant whores, but as with narratives about virgin martyrs, I would argue that if to a certain extent such narratives were empowering for some women, this would entail the internalization of an extremely contemptuous and negative view of the female body. Whereas the male poet and the men in the audience can displace sinful desires and anxieties onto women’s bodies in theMarie l’Égyptienne narratives, women readers are implicitly enjoined to contemplate their own bodies as the incarnation of sin and as a threat not only to their own spiritual well-being, but to that of all the men they encounter. Paradoxically they are also invited to view their bodies as the source of their salvation if they are prepared to submit them to extreme punishment. Religious symbols are indeed complex.” (Gaunt 227-228)↩︎\n “For our saints, the assembly of the body-in-pieces into a statuesque fixity is not yet necessarily complete, much less owned. There is still, and I would argue that perhaps there is indefinitely, the flailing of limbs en route to stasis. At the threshold of the visible, at the threshold of the visceral, the saint is always turning” (345-346).↩︎\n Campbell links this copy (T-B) of Mary the Egyptian’s Life to other neighboring saints’ Lives — specifically Alexis  andEuphrosine — found in the same manuscript, comparing each saints’ rejections of family and society (159).↩︎\n These manuscript copies are specified in the primary sources of her bibliography (253). Campbell also briefly traces the use of the label ‘confession’ to categorize Mary’s recounting of her life to Zozimas across several French versions (T, X, V, N, and W) to note the instability of this categorization of Mary’s speech (161n33).↩︎\n “L’éparpillement extrême des textes hagiographiques, leur évolution au fil du temps ou de la géographie, le caractère souvent inédit des manuscrits risquaient de grever cette analyse comparative en la privant de l’homogénéité nécessaire à toute entreprise littéraire ou stylistique” (89-90).↩︎\n Gaunt describes Mary’s penitent body as ‘hideous’ twice in his chapter: “As an old and hideous naked woman…” (214); “Later descriptions of Marie as a hideous wild woman…” (219). And Emma Campbell refers to Mary the Egyptian’s penitent body as “characterized by physical ugliness” (160) for example. However, Robertson finds beauty in Mary’s penitent form, “The second descriptio  describesbeauty as much as does the first” (“Poem and Spirit” 321).↩︎\n The reader of Zozimas-centered versions of the legend is denied this transformation as Mary the Egyptian is only encountered in her ascetic form. Pinto-Mathieu describes how Jacobus de Voragine actively denies Mary the Egyptian any redeeming aesthetic qualities, presenting her exclusively as “un diable noirci” (100).↩︎\n Dembowski provides these variants in his edition (75n177; 88n643).↩︎\n “A iceu tens n’ert si bele femme / kar ele estoit sur tutes gemme” (vv.163-164 of T-C)↩︎\n In T-A, she is called mossue  once: “N’iert merveille se iert moussue” (v. 664). In T-B, she is called mossue  twice and polhue  once: “& de blanc poilh tote mossue / Noire & polhue ert la poitrine … N’ert mervelhe s’ele ert mossue” (vv.590-591 & 607 of T-B). In T-C, she is calledmossue  three times: “e de blanc peil tote mossue / Noire e mossue la peitrine … Ne fu merveille s’ert mossue” (vv.652-653 & 676 of T-C). She is only calledmossue  once in copies T-D and T-E: “N’ert merveille s’ele ert mossue” (v.666 of T-D); “N’iert par merveille s’iert molsue” (v.666 of T-E). And although I cannot personally confirm the full verse as it is written in T-L due to my lack of access to the British Library, Dembowski notes the presence ofmossue as a variation present in this copy as well (88n641).↩︎\n On the issue of ‘clutter,’ Tufte argues, “‘Clutter’ in data graphics is evidence that your models don’t fit the data – and that you know it. You also know that your summary graphics cover up contrary data and depict dubious thresholds not present in the data set. Such cheats are obvious and easily detected, and damage your credibility” (Tufte 101). In traditional editions, ‘clutter’ is tucked away in the extensive paratextual notes — if such notes are included at all — that the interested reader must then decode in order to fully grasp both the source material and the editor’s interventions in order to craft well-founded arguments on the available textual data.↩︎\n Cerquiglini also mentions Jean Rychner’s Le Lai de Lanval (1958) and Willem Noomen and Nico Van den Boogaard’s* Nouveau Recueil complet des fabliaux* (1983).↩︎\n These copies have been given the labels A, B, C, D, E, L, F1, and F2. Alfred T. Baker is responsible for labeling the many versions and manuscript copies of the French Mary the Egyptian legend with their current sigla in his 1916 edition. Dembowski uses Baker’s system in his own 1977 edition, building on Baker’s labeling where appropriate. For example, T-F1 was unknown to Baker, and so, Dembowski is responsible for lettering the T fragments with superscript numbers. I follow Dembowski’s labels, and I provide more in-depth descriptions of each of the T copies in Appendix 1 of this dissertation.↩︎\n We do currently have several print editions of Version T of the Life of Mary the Egyptian, each selecting a different manuscript as their choice of base text. As mentioned above, Dembowski’s La Vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne: Versions en ancien et en moyen français (1977) opts for copy T-A as its base text; Michèle Cruz-Sáenz offers an edition of copy T-B in her* The Life of Saint Mary of Egypt: An Edition and Study of the Medieval French and Spanish Verse Redactions (1979). Prior to these 1970s editions, Baker published his critical edition — which is a composite of several T manuscripts — beside an edited transcript of manuscript copy T-C in an issue of the Revue des langues romanes*(1916), and Matthew Cooke published his edition — “très inexactement transcrit” according to Dembowski (16) — of T-C in 1852.↩︎\n Robertson’s article was written with the approval of Peter Dembowski who Robertson acknowledges from the outset, “I wish to thank Peter F. Dembowski for his critical reading of this article, and for his patient counsel throughout all my hagiographical researches” (“The Anglo-Norman Verse” 13).↩︎\n Cerquiglini demonstrates the difficulty of reconstructing variants from such a critical apparatus in Éloge de la variante (1989). Armed with an editor’s encoded notes as well as pencil and paper, “Le lecteur patient, et indocile, mal satisfait de l’unicité qu’on lui offre, en retire quelques fragments, des lambeaux, des éclats, mais non pas cet autre du texte que l’apparat critique a pour fonction secrète d’éparpiller sourdement” (106).↩︎\n Robertson makes this argument particularly in reference to the T corpus, but he notes that this criticism may validly be leveled against any  edition of almostany  text from the Old French canon: “For this work and for most others in the Old French canon, modern editors have chosen rather to present editions based on single manuscripts, emending these as little as possible. … The problem inherent in this approach (by no means unique toSt. Mary the Egyptian) is that no one of the extant manuscripts adequately represents the poem. In all except A and C, large gaps caused by omissions or mutilations appear in the final pages. All of them, with the possible exception of L, show extensive interventions performed by the individual scribes, voluntarily or no. This factor visibly affects A and B as well as C — more so perhaps than their respective editions acknowledge” (“The Anglo-Norman Verse Life” 31). Similarly, Arthur Bahr calls the traditional practice of choosing only one manuscript as the base text for an edition an “ascetic” practice that limits our understanding of the miscellaneous (191).↩︎\n In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I narrow my reader’s focus to consider the features of the two portraits of Mary the Egyptian, providing edited transcriptions of each T copy as well as English translations unique to each of these copies.↩︎\n Robinson — himself a digital editor of medieval manuscripts — cautions against this sort of work, “Making a real electronic scholarly edition is far, far harder than writing a book, and takes far, far longer. Anyone who has had anything to do with electronic editions will tell you this. … If this is what you want to do, here is what I will tell you. Sell the family dog. Lock the door to your study and don’t come out for twenty years” (“The Ends of Editing” 20).↩︎\n Bryant’s The Fluid Text: A Theory of Revision and Editing for Book and Screen (2002) provides a useful starting point for rethinking our approach to editing as one that should convey the fluidity of texts to the reader and not merely a polished final product: “Typically, textual scholars are content to showcase the clear reading text they have labored to produce, relegating the textual apparatus, which contains the evidence of textual fluidity, to a secondary position for readers to inspect, if they desire. Thus, learning about the text is optional, and this is (perhaps) acceptable, if all you want to do is read a single, fixed text. But in reading a fluid text, learning about the text (that is, its variants) is not optional. Not only must the reader read self-consciously but the editor must make the edition aware of itself, and readably so. The apparatus must be more visible, and enticing. It must teach readers how to read what they are reading” (122-123). Bryant’s own digital editing work is the Melville Electronic Library, which seeks to present the works of Melville to online users as products of long revision by many hands, Melville’s and others.↩︎\n As Andrew Prescott argues, insisting on the direct consultation of original manuscripts is highly impractical for most researchers, “Although digitized manuscripts promote a wider public appreciation of medieval manuscripts, they are nevertheless for de Hamel ultimately ‘rootless and untied to any place’. De Hamel’s insistence on consulting the original manuscript is, in the context of the celebrity manuscripts featured in his book, absurd, since virtually nobody can have any hope of handling any of the manuscripts de Hamel discusses. Every manuscript scholar will agree that it is hazardous to rely on digital images alone, but there are few scholars who could follow in de Hamel’s footsteps by obtaining permission to handle the Gospels of St Augustine, the Codex Amiatinus, and the Book of Kells. They have to use whatever digital surrogates are available” (40).↩︎",

    "text": "New Philology and the Digital Turn: Opportunities and Anxieties\nThe call of New Philology — issued more than thirty years ago —11 demanded medievalists move away from the hypothesizing work of the text-critical approach in favor of studying texts as they are actually attested in the extant manuscript record. Calling it a “postmodern return to the origins of medieval studies” (7) in his introduction to the movement, Stephen G. Nichols insisted that we welcome the plurality of medieval culture by positioning plurality at the core of our methods:\nContemporaneous with the rise of Digital Humanities, I would argue that adherents to New Philology have benefited greatly from the digital advancements that have made it increasingly feasible to embrace variance.\nTo fully embark on the New Philology turn, scholars require access to surviving copies of medieval texts, including fragmentary ones. And so, the digitization of manuscripts becomes imperative for comprehensive research, as most scholars cannot afford the time and resources necessary to physically explore every relevant scrap of parchment and paper worldwide. Libraries around the world are striving to make their special collections both discoverable and remotely accessible to researchers and educators, but this is a massive undertaking that requires significant time, funding, and collaboration across institutions. The Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), for example, established its digital library, Gallica, in 1997 and has since digitized and made freely available millions of documents,12 and in North America, Digital Scriptorium — a growing consortium of U.S. institutions with premodern manuscripts — is pushing to create a national catalog where researchers can find documents pertinent to their work all in one digital space. An even greater challenge in terms of discoverability and accessibility is piecing together the many fragments of premodern manuscripts that have been scattered about the world over time, but the digital lab Fragmentarium has created a platform in which scholars may digitally reunite fragments to gain insights that would otherwise be nearly impossible for researchers to see in the real world. More and more, scholars are able to do in the digital space what they have rarely, if ever, been able to do in prestigious and private reading rooms: compare manuscripts side-by-side, zoom in far closer than would normally be permissible, and spend long hours with ‘manuscripts’ all while enjoying a coffee.13 Countless members of library staff labor every day to make this digital revolution possible, and this labor is only just beginning to be recognized as itself invaluable intellectual labor.14\nAnd yet, these major developments in digitization over the past several decades bring with them major anxieties as some scholars continue to cry out for the preservation of more traditional methods. Writing in defense of reading on a human scale and at a human pace, Ryan Szpiech provides a thorough manifesto in “Cracking the Code: Reflections on Manuscripts in the Age of Digital Books” (2014) on the primacy of reading physical manuscripts over any other format.15 Embracing fetishism and railing against utility,16 Szpiech perceives the manuscript to be an “anti-book” (87) ever capable of resisting any digital methods to contain it.17 Szpiech insists he is no “Luddite” (87); rather, he argues, “If our goal is dialogue, engagement, contemplation, or reading — reading for meaning, for inspiration, for cadence, for form, for beauty, or for any other intangible good — then electronic tools are of only limited use, and may just as well prove a hindrance.” (87). And even more relevant to the work of this dissertation, Szpiech writes vehemently against the production of digital editions and digital facsimiles:\nIt is difficult in some ways to counter Szpiech’s arguments. His elegizing of the physical manuscript resonates with anyone who has experienced the tactile and intellectual thrill of handling one. Yet his rhetoric ultimately relies on the false assumption that digital resources are produced for the purpose of wholly usurping manuscripts rather than simply supplementing their various limitations. While I share Szpiech’s desire to cultivate reverence for the material manuscript and believe digital tools should encourage curiosity for the original object, I reject the idea that physical proximity is the only true path to meaningful engagement, and I find Szpiech’s model an exclusionary gesture that runs contrary to the ethos of intellectual generosity on which our field depends.18 His claim that digital resources merely “bedazzle” overlooks the real practical barriers — geographic, financial, institutional, and pedagogical — that prevent most readers from ever encountering manuscripts in the flesh. Moreover, to frame digital remediation as a threat to knowledge rather than an expansion of it either implies that engagement with medieval manuscripts should be limited exclusively to experts who do have the means and ability to interact with them directly or assumes an imagined universal reader who sees, travels, deciphers, and handles manuscripts with equal ease to such experts. In reality, digitized manuscripts, digital editions, and other digital materials, are not idolatries but invitations — entry points that democratize access, foster inquiry, and supplement rather than supplant the “frail human object” that Szpiech and I both venerate.\nSzpiech’s article articulates many of the key concerns scholars have raised in response to the increased use of digital methods in manuscript studies. Each of these concerns — about the idolization of digital technologies, the perceived loss of materiality, the instability of new forms of media, and the fear of displacement by machines — invite response and clarification. Many digitally-inclined medievalists have already addressed these anxieties. In the following list, I highlight these ongoing arguments and advocate for a more positive outlook:",

    "text": "If we accept the multiple forms in which our artifacts have been transmitted, we may recognize that medieval culture did not simply live with diversity, it cultivated it. The ‘new’ philology of the last decade or more reminds us that, as medievalists, we need to embrace the consequences of that diversity, not simply to live with it, but to situate it squarely within our methodology. (8-9)\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the critical edition, which has the unlikely virtue of being dry and difficult to use (and thus at least never truly threatening to replace the manuscript with the sign of itself), and unlike the printed facsimile, which has the virtue of requiring the reader to use it more or less as he or she would use the manuscript itself (and thus provoking no essential imbalance in power between the knower and the known), the digital edition and the digital facsimile bedazzle the reader and create interpretive disequilibrium with the effectiveness and intensity of their simulation. Just as Google Books does not simply strive to augment the reading of a book but to actually replace the reader’s book with the searcher’s book, so the ultimate goal of digital editions and digital facsimiles, I believe, is not only to reflect the “original,” to “capture” or “recapture” it, but to effectively replace it with a better image of itself. Whereas philology (like fetishism) creates a “desire for presence,” digital philology creates a simulacrum or iconic replacement for this presence. I see the ultimate danger of the latter as its guileful power to make us prefer it over the real that it represents, and to forget the real entirely before its coded perfection. The injunction from Kings against graven images rings in my ears, and I choose a fetishism of the frail human object over an idolatry of the power of the machine. (93-94)\n\n\n\n\n1. Fetishism and Idolatry\nIn response to the digital turn, scholars like Szpiech turned toward fetishizing the physical manuscript. Whearty captures this reactionary impulse with clarity:\n\nAs a response to the perceived threat of media extinction, researchers rushed to emphasize the unique sensory experiences of the material book — smell, sound, touch — as both aesthetic experience and scholarly data. Bookish objects that did not smell, sound, or feel the same as the material book (and that therefore lacked those familiar data) could be an amusement or a threat, but they could not be “real” books. (Digital Codicology 12).\n\nThe impulse to fetishize the material object frames digital and physical formats as oppositional, implying that one must necessarily displace the other. But this dichotomy fails to account for the ways in which digital and material forms serve complementary purposes.19 As Lit has observed, the experience of engaging with a digitized manuscript is not lesser or counterfeit, but simply different:\n\n…it is not like using digitized manuscripts will get you none or only a shadow of the experience you would get from handling the real artifact. Rather, you simply get another experience. … I therefore conclude that discussions on the relationship between digitized and material manuscripts have brought us little to nothing. It is neither correct to see digitized manuscripts as better than their material counterparts, nor is it correct to see them as worse than them. (Lit 62)20\n\nThe digital manuscript is not a replacement for the physical one, but a tool that can generate further interest in it, supplement its accessibility, and even reveal aspects not immediately visible to the naked eye. Nichols provides a helpful comparison, likening the process of digitization to the production of modern digital recordings of classical music:\n\nThey are neither copies, nor forgeries, nor clones threatening to usurp the rightful place of the manuscript they preserve in images. Strictly speaking they are, like the digital sound recording of Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony, a digital recording of the manuscript with vision replacing sound. Precisely because they attest the existence of the manuscript so perfectly, they acknowledge their secondary status as record. They do not conceal their status as a dynamic transposition of an historical artifact into a preservation format that also realizes a mandate as important for libraries as preservation: public access. Whereas in the past, only a privileged few could view, read, and study these artifacts, now they are widely available to scholars, students, and those who are merely curious. (From Parchment to Cyberspace 53)21\n\nWhy should medieval manuscripts be uniquely sacralized, as though they lose all value when transposed into a different medium? And is it really true that access to a digital copy or edition discourages desire for the material object?\nHighlighting the sort of gateway drug effect that pulls many modern readers into medieval literature and eventually into manuscript studies, Michelle Warren writes in Holy Digital Grail: A Medieval Book on the Internet (2022), “The first medieval book most people read is a modern edition” (193) and “The first medieval manuscript most people open is likely a web page” (238). Somewhat counterintuitively, surrogates for the medieval manuscript are what bring people into the reading room, not shoo them away from it. The modern edition (print or digital) and the modern facsimile (print or digital) are most often the first interaction one might have with a medieval text, not the last.\nThis was certainly the case in my own experience with T-F2. It was because the Staatsbibliothek had digitized the early twentieth-century photographs of the lost fragment that I became aware of its continued — if mediated — existence. And it was because I first engaged with the fragment digitally — transcribing it, comparing my transcription with earlier editions, puzzling over its illegibility — that I eventually sought out the photographs in person. That decision was fueled not by a sense of disconnection, but by a desire cultivated through virtual access. The surrogate did not replace the original; it intensified my desire to encounter the material trace more directly.22 But I recognize that I am among a privileged minority of scholars with the institutional support, training, and funding necessary to make that journey. For many, the digital surrogate is not a stepping stone to the reading room — it is the reading room. And this is not a failure of the digital, but its power: it allows more people to engage with medieval materials than ever before, often in greater detail and with fewer logistical obstacles.23\nIt is a valid concern that the increased prevalence of digital surrogates might make libraries reluctant to grant access to original materials,24 but when access to the original is truly required — when scholarly questions demand material consultation — libraries most often do continue to honor that need, balancing their dual missions of preserving the objects they curate and supporting intellectual inquiry. The availability of alternative forms of access serves to protect the precious manuscript from unnecessary handling, and scholars benefit from taking advantage of both the manuscript and its copies. Rather than seeing digital, print, and manuscript media as steps in a teleological chain or rungs in a hierarchy, we would do better to view them as simultaneous, coexisting forms — each with distinct affordances, each capable of fulfilling different needs. Digital formats are not a threat, but rather, an extension of the original, a record of the material object, and an invitation to look more closely — both at what we might feel in our hands and what we might only glimpse through glass.25\n\n\n2. (Im)material and (In)human\nA common anxiety about digital materials is that they are somehow less ‘real’ — immaterial, disembodied, or inhuman. But Whearty reminds us that this is an illusion, and she draws our attention to the ever-present human labors behind all technologies, “The digital presents itself as immaterial, unmediated, unproduced by human laborers. But that is a lie. Humans are always there. They always have been” (Digital Codicology 120). Digital manuscripts may lack the tactile qualities of parchment, but they are no less material. They reside on physical servers, require environmental infrastructure, and are shaped at every stage by human labor and interpretation. Whearty identifies the roots of this misunderstanding in two late twentieth-century rhetorics, “… first, that digital things are disembodied, with no real physical form; and second, that analog books are under threat of extinction from these disembodied digital forms” (Digital Codicology 11), and she memorably answers these concerns writing, “Pixels can represent parchment, but they cannot become it” (Digital Codicology 12). Whearty’s distinction here is essential. The digital does not erase the material; it reframes it. Recognizing the digital as materially grounded and human-produced for human purposes allows us to move beyond unproductive debates over what is and is not ‘real.’\nSimilarly, the term ‘ghost’ is used frequently in discussions of digitized manuscripts by detractors and supporters of digitization alike. In the chapter “The Ghost in the Machine: Digital Avatars of Medieval Manuscripts” (2008), Siân Echard argues that we have not learned to see through the illusion of the digital facsimile in the same way that we have print editions:\n\nThe screenic presentation seen by Cerquiglini as liberating also haunts us with the substitution of one body for another – a substitution that happened in the world of the printed edition, too, but which we have there at least learned to recognize. The trick with the digital facsimile is that the language of reality and presence, allied with the public mantra of accessibility, implies a kind of transparency, when what is offered is in fact an opaque simulacrum, one that is ‘uncannily’ familiar. (215)\n\nI am skeptical of the idea that we have learned to recognize and separate print editions from their ‘original’ source manuscripts when print editions are most frequently the sole source of our literary scholarship. It is true that editions do not attempt to be the source manuscript in the same sense that digital facsimiles might, but most readers of editions tend to believe that they are faithful representations of the ‘true’ immaterial text — truer even than the messy medieval manuscript copy — as editors typically attempt to promote the authority of their editions by downplaying the intervention of their editing. Every edition is a fabrication, the product of an editor’s labor, but editions are subjected to far less questioning that digitized manuscripts seem to be. Tamsyn Mahoney-Steel rightly acknowledges the ghostly relationship between our sources and our editions:\n\nLatent within our theories of editing and efforts as editors is an unnecessary dualism. Just as philosophers have posited and tried to overcome mind-body and mind-world dualism, so we can posit and attempt to surmount such a rift between the edition and its source. Whether or not we subscribe to Bédier’s idea of the ‘best text’, or Karl Lachmann’s stemmatics, the text, in some fashion or another, hovers at our shoulder like a ghostly entity, demanding to be perfectly rendered and expressed in our edition. We console ourselves that a one-to-one translation from source to edition is never possible, and that somehow with each attempt at editing we must try to come closer to the source, even though like Achilles we can never pass the tortoise. (136)\n\nEither by way of digitization or editing, we may try to come ever closer to our source material, but we know we can never match it. We cannot ask any one iteration or format to do everything, but approaching our source material in multiple ways can help to fill in the inevitable gaps that emerge between the ‘original’ and its representation. In her blog “The Uncanny Valley and the Ghost in the Machine” (2018), Dot Porter encourages us to think practically about the work we do with these resources,\n\n… I do a lot of thinking about what is is we do. And there’s a question, one question that keeps me up at nights [sic] and drives the focus of my current research. The question comes out of a statement and that statement is: The digitized manuscript is not the manuscript itself. … If the digitized manuscript isn’t the manuscript, then what is it? This is not actually the question that keeps me up nights, because although this is interesting, it’s not practical or useful for me. My job is to make these things available so you can use them. So the question that actually keeps me up at night is: If a digitized manuscript isn’t a manuscript, how can we present it in ways that explore aspects of the original’s manuscript-ness, ethically and with care, while both pushing and respecting the boundaries of technology? Although this practice of thinking about what it means to digitize a manuscript and what that becomes seems really philosophical, this is really [a] practical question. (Porter’s emphasis)\n\nPorter underscores the need for digital practices that are critically self-aware, technically thoughtful, and above all, aligned with the curator’s joint missions of care and preservation, outreach and engagement, and research and scholarship. Echoing this constructive outlook, Deborah McGrady, in her work on the digitized Machaut corpus, urges us to consider the benefits of these disembodied representations, “While we may lament that the digitized manuscript ghosts the book, we may need to stop and consider how digital matter can also enliven texts by providing unprecedented access to textual bodies and by resuscitating the desires that shaped the medieval reading experience” (22-23).\nTied up in this anxiety of immateriality is the question of accessibility. As I have already suggested in this chapter of the dissertation, supplemental digital materials provide greater access to the medieval manuscript and the texts they contain, but what is meant by ‘access’? Accessibility, in this context, is not merely the physical availability of source material but also the rendering of that source material intellectually understandable to broader swaths of users.26 Good digital work does not aim to strip away context or reduce texts to machine-readable data just for the sake of doing so. On the contrary, digitized manuscripts and digital editions both ideally offer layered environments in which readers can pose more — and more varied — humanities questions. In other words, access is not about proximity — it is about participation. As Whearty argues, access must be understood as a set of layered affordances:\n\nIn the ‘decade of digitization,’ digital ‘access’ was not developed as some bait-and-switch, telling certain kinds of end users that they ought to content themselves with just looking at photographs and descriptive metadata displayed on modern screens. … Rather, ‘access’ was seen as a series of tiered tools through which larger and more diverse populations of end users could become more involved in the work of book history: reading, touching, and building things; verifying with their own eyes inherited editorial wisdom; and subjecting claims to sustained, communal scrutiny. Ultimately, recovering these older understandings of ‘access’ — as the intertwined abilities to make, read, explore; to engage; to weigh and agree, or disagree and critique — shows a different past to digital manuscript projects. It also suggests a different future. Rather than quibbling over whether research done using digital manuscripts is or is not real, rigorous work (that horse has left the barn and cannot be returned: people are using digital manuscript projects as sources for their scholarship), we might synthesize and revise this constellation of older, more focused definitions: to have access to information about whether something exists, to have access to the training to do the work we feel called to do, to have the ability to participate and lead as well as consume and follow, to be able to collaborate, critique, and work together to see old things anew. (Digital Codicology 167; Whearty’s emphasis)\n\nFramed in this way, digital access is not a poor, virtual substitute for the ‘real thing,’ but a means of broadening what counts as legitimate scholarly inquiry. Rather than reducing complex humanities work to brute computation, good digital work amplifies texts, making them more searchable, retrievable, discoverable, legible, comprehensible. Digital methods are not about turning manuscripts into cold, uninterpretable data. They are about opening the archive, structuring its materials thoughtfully, and inviting in more humans to read texts and ask and answer questions.\n\n\n3. Ephemeral and Error-prone\nCritics of digital scholarship often point to its ephemerality: websites break, formats go obsolete, links rot, and platforms collapse. Such impermanence, however, is not unique to the digital. Print and manuscript objects degrade, fall out of circulation, and are shaped by schools of thought that over time become outmoded and expire. The instability of media — whether parchment, paper, or pixel — is not a modern phenomenon but a long-standing feature of intellectual history. Longevity is not a reason to avoid digital methods but a reason to remain reflexive and iterative in our approaches. Nothing lasts forever. A lack of longevity does not mean that something may not be worth doing in the present, and relatedly, trying and failing in the present is how we progress in the future.\nIn “Adam Scriveyn in Cyberspace: Loss, Labour, Ideology, and Infrastructure in Interoperable Reuse of Digital Manuscript Metadata” (2018), Whearty insists that to give end users the appearance of permanence and perfection in a digital project — to mimic the illusion of authority print editions typically convey — should not be the goal: “…hiding our ghosts contributes to an incorrect impression that all digital manuscripts can be all things, to all people, in the first iteration” (195). We cannot anticipate the demands of all future scholars and general readers who may encounter our work, and we cannot provide everything to everyone, but as long as we, digital humanists, make our methods, our data, and our decisions transparent and reproducible, we will provide users with what Whearty has reframed as “raw materials that are passed on to the future, an archive of labor, into which someone may yet breathe new, unexpected life” (Digital Codicology 211).27 Sustainability, in this model, does not mean building something that lasts forever. It means building something that can be learned from and revised as needed.\nWhearty warns that the real danger to scholarly trust in the digital is not error or deterioration, but the invisible correction — silent changes to digital objects that create a “crisis of authenticity” (Digital Codicology 228) and obscure what came before:\n\nMy objection is less that updates happen, or even that updates overwrite earlier copies: it is the silence with which these updates occur. That I would argue is the real risk to authenticity posed by digital manuscripts. It is not that digital manuscripts somehow chip away their hard-copy exemplars’ unique auras or destroy some underlying foundation of the “real.” It is not even that institutions and experts can enter into a digital manuscript and alter its structures and content: that’s been happening to analog manuscripts for as long as analog manuscripts have existed. It’s that when changes are made to digital manuscripts, they should not be invisible. (Digital Codicology 201; Whearty’s emphasis)\n\nWhearty calls for greater transparency in how digital projects evolve. Her ideal solution is the use of Version Control Systems (VCSs) like Git,28 but she also suggests low-tech interventions as simple as giving born-digital files clear version numbers to indicate change over time (Digital Codicology 231). By openly acknowledging the emendation of glitches and gaps, Whearty argues that we will prevent not just the reinvention of wheels but especially of “broken wheels” (Digital Codicology 207).\nJust as reproducibility has become a concern in the sciences, we face a similar ongoing crisis in medieval manuscript studies.29 The long history of warring editorial practices is marked by the unending desire to address the reader’s lack of confidence in the editions available.30 How can any given reader feel totally assured of the editor’s work? In the absence of more widespread public access to manuscripts, their surrogate images, and clearer documentation of editorial decision-making, readers are typically left to accept the existing editions of medieval texts based on their faith in the editor alone. As Françoise Vieillard and Olivier Guyotjeannin advise in their Conseils pour l’édition des textes médiévaux (2001), the editor must make their decisions clear to the reader via the introduction to the edition and additional notes so that the reader is in a position to judge the editor’s work.31 But how can any reader truly judge the work of the editor if they do not have access to the source manuscripts themselves? Cerquiglini writes that readers of print editions have no other recourse but to accept the editor’s work with “la générosité loyale” (112), but digital methods offer the potential to break these epistemic barriers.\nAs Peter Robinson has observed, “In the days of the print edition, one could only raise such questions by, effectively, redoing all the editor’s work.” (“Electronic Editions” 7). And as I have experienced myself in working through Tobler and Dembowski’s previous editions of T-F2, truly verifying an edition requires hunting down either the original manuscripts or images of it, transcribing and editing it anew, effectively replicating their editorial labors. And whereas Dembowski provides his transcription of T-F2 in his extensive variance notes — which must be manually reconstructed by the reader —, and Tobler simply claims in his introduction that he has inserted a ‘few missing letters’,32 my digital edition of T-F2 (available in Appendix 2) is able to connect readers to the digitized surrogate images of the fragment and to present T-F2 with more clearly established levels of editorial intervention that may be understood without requiring the reader to decipher and piece together encoded notes.33 The progress made here is not some radical change to the way we transcribe and edit texts, but rather in the reader’s ability to reasonably recognize and verify the editor’s work and to feel more confident in the text presented. As Lit has argued, “A more obvious breakthrough, already gained, is that editions can now be based much easier on manuscript witnesses from all corners of the world, and it is fairly easy to check existing editions against actual manuscript evidence” (98). With the increased adoption of digitization and digital editing, we can do more to address the crisis of confidence in our readers, and as Lit further argues, these methods enable readers to then assess our scholarly arguments with greater scrutiny, “…whereas before we could not expect our readers to have access to the manuscripts in order to fact-check our argumentation” (100). If we can more rigorously evaluate our editions via increased access to medieval manuscripts and their digital surrogates, then we can feel more confident in the validity of all our scholarly output resulting from such editions. When images are publicly available, and editions are designed for interrogation and interaction, manuscript studies as an endeavor becomes more reproducible and transparent — without sacrificing complexity or rigor. This is not a lowering of standards (with flashy, bedazzling webpages replacing paper books); it is a raising of standards as we hold ourselves evermore accountable to the scrutiny of our readers.\n\n\n4. Automation and Augmentation\nOne final concern to address is the prevalent fear that machines will replace human intellectual work, but digital tools are not autonomous agents poised to displace us. They are instruments of human creation — powerful only in the hands of those who learn to wield them effectively.34\nThough he welcomes advancements in automation, Lit specifically addresses the need for human thought and judgement even in seemingly straightforward fields like paleography:\n\n… paleography is not hard enough to be fully automatized, but not soft enough to disregard automated analysis. I think, then, that automated text recognition, when it is advanced enough to be implemented into our normal workflow, will be a great help for editors, but it remains only that — a help. (117)\n\nThough transcription may seem ripe for automation, “…transcription itself is not an objective task but can be considered an editorial task dependent on the editor’s erudition” (Lit 172). For example, Alpo Honkapohja’s Digital Medievalist article “Digital Approaches to Manuscript Abbreviations” (2021) presents the many complications associated with extracting insights from scribal abbreviations via digitally encoded transcriptions and how these complications necessitate human intervention. First, both the paleographic appearance of abbreviations and their intended expansions may vary greatly over time and context, and even individual scribal abbreviations may give conflicting instructions on how they should be expanded and understood by the reader. Second, normalizing text transcriptions — standard practice in modern editing — leads to the loss of potentially valuable information that could, for example, be used by paleographers to date and localize source manuscripts. And finally, while automatically generated data may be a useful research tool, Honkapohja cautions, “The risk is that automatic processes might generate huge quantities of bad data” (para. 58). At every stage, informed human judgement is essential to producing good data and using that good data to ask and answer human questions. And despite the many challenges associated with such research, Honkapohja suggests we are moving towards “something of a golden age for this fascinating area of study” (para. 58).\nEven prior to the digital turn, Foulet and Speer likewise reject any tendencies toward excessive automation in the editing process:\n\nA purely mechanical system of editing (even if such a thing exists) is inappropriate for Old French Texts; hence the editor’s informed judgment or subjectivity must play a crucial role in each stage of the editing process. Any edition is a conjecture; it also constitutes a critical interpretation of the text. (38)\n\nDigital methods will never erase the need for human expertise. On the contrary, they will always demand it. Decisions about transcription, editing, markup, visualization, and design all depend on scholarly judgment, and adopting new methods does not mean we throw away useful traditional methods and knowledge. We have, rather, the opportunity to revisit and refine our practices with new tools and techniques. The very act of doing digital work forces us to rethink our methodology and ‘do the work’ of critically thinking about what we are doing and why we are doing it. And simply, “Sometimes, ‘doing the same thing faster’ is indeed a revolution … because we do things that otherwise would not be done. In this sense, much is already accomplished when we can look more closely at what we can already see” (Warren “Situating Digital Archives” 173).\nRather than entrenching ourselves in old workflows, digital methods invite us to shed some of the constraints inherited from the print paradigm and reconsider the goals and structures of our editorial practices. Andrew Prescott captures this well when he writes:\n\nIt is not the digital image which is rootless but rather the printed editions on which we have previously relied. Digitization enables scholars to reintegrate text and manuscript. Medieval manuscripts fuse text and image in ways that challenge our logocentric ways of thinking. Digitization enables us to once again view text as image. (46)\n\nIndeed, the limitations of print — linearity, singularity, invisibility of variance — have long shaped modern expectations of what a ‘text’ is.35 As Farkas Gábor Kiss et al. note in “Old Light on New Media: Medieval Practices in the Digital Age” (2013), many digital editions still cling to the constraints of print as the greater exploration of new digital formats continues to emerge:\n\nThe text as a singular, self-identical subject is primarily a product of the printing press, which restricted the number of circulating variants and obfuscated the diversity of manuscript culture. The digital environment does not require such parsimonious handling of surviving sources, as it has the potential to represent texts in a way that reflects their medieval existence. Yet, it seems that this potential remains unexploited in many digital editions that still carry on the burdensome heritage of the printed book. (18)\n\nKiss et al. understand that embracing both digital methods and the New Philology movement comes with intimidating challenges, but they are adamant that scholars must push through this moment of transition from print to truly digital editions so that we might thoughtfully engage with all available textual witnesses and place more power in the hands of our readers.36 As Kiss et al. argue, the digital edition has the potential to more closely mirror medieval modes of reading, which were often fluid and open (22); non-linear (23-24); interactive of text, image, and sound (24-25); complex in reception (25-27); scalable in information (27-28); and composed of composite textual features (28-29).37 What they propose — and what I take as a helpful model for the edition produced in this dissertation — is a more expansive editorial approach than print may typically afford, one that embraces variance and offers readers multiple legitimate pathways through the text. In this dissertation, each manuscript witness of Version T is presented on a more equal footing to provide a fuller picture of the T corpus. Readers can encounter the text of each manuscript copy as desired and plainly understand my editorial decisions without deciphering dense paratextual notes. The goal is not to hide my intervention as a digital editor but to make my interventions more immediately apparent, obvious, and legible so that readers may have a greater sense of confidence in the validity of the texts presented.38\nEditions — print and digital editions — of medieval texts are highly mediated works, but digital editions offer functionality capable of more fully presenting the variance of medieval texts than traditional print editions.39 Paradoxically, it is by embracing variance (by embracing the digital) that we find a greater sense of stability within the texts — even the infamously variable poetic works — of the manuscript age. By allowing readers to explore multiple manuscript witnesses side by side, to follow points of variation through visualizations, and to see editorial decisions foregrounded rather than hidden, the digital edition can offer a more honest — and more philologically responsible — account of the medieval text. This vision aligns with Nichols’s concept of the ‘mutable stability’ of medieval texts:\n\nPoetic structure in the manuscript age is dynamic; it constantly accommodates the stress of modification without losing its ability to adjust to load changes or to suffer any reduction in performance or loss of identity. That is the basis for the medieval paradox I call ‘mutable stability.’ (From Parchment to Cyberspace 94)40\n\nAccording to this line of thinking, then, the goal of the most useful form of digital edition should be not to recover a lost original — the textual critic’s goal — or flatten manuscript variance into a single idealized form. Rather, it should be to embrace the dynamics of manuscript transmission, to give readers tools to explore that variance meaningfully, and to reflect the complex textual realities of the Middle Ages.41 Nichols critiques the modern tendency of the print edition to strip away the very elements that make a work medieval:\n\nArmed with information about the manuscript tradition, textual scholars could then produce a critical edition. But in the quest to recreate an authentic text of the work, everything that made it a truly medieval artifact was jettisoned. By virtue of presenting the text as a printed book, the critical edition necessarily modernizes medieval works. … however, anyone reading such a text would have only the vaguest idea that the printed version represented scores of manuscript copies all differing in a variety of ways from it (and from each other). (From Parchment to Cyberspace 2; Nichols’s emphasis)\n\nAlthough traditional print editing practices generally do an excellent job of transmitting medieval texts to modern readers, I would argue that their main flaw is that they are too clean, too streamlined. Our desire for tidiness, our expectation that there is one singular authoritative Text to be reproduced, distorts the reality of medieval texts that survive in material manuscripts where there is almost never an ‘original’ version and where practically speaking there is no such thing as a ‘final’ copy. Modern editing methods are great for the production of static print editions (that can only be so large and can only be reedited and reprinted every so often), but by applying digital editing approaches, we might ironically be able to engage with these medieval texts more completely. We can create editions that embrace variety and reflect the animate nature of these texts that were meant to live in circulation, copied and edited from one hand to the next. Digital editions, then, may at least be conceived of as augmentations to the more familiar print edition.\nTo conclude this list, digital resources, such as full-color images of digitized manuscripts and digitally searchable metadata, have augmented our ability to access and study manuscripts. Yet, this shift does not render the methods and materials of the past obsolete by any means. Microfilms, for example, remain valuable when direct access to the original manuscript is impossible, and the in-person consultation of manuscripts continues to provide insights that digital surrogates do not replicate or replace. Digital resources enhance our ability to conduct thorough research, while print resources retain their value, particularly in times when digital access is compromised. Clearly, the work we are doing is largely unchanged — like turn-of-the-twentieth-century German philologists who examined the Damascus fragments, we, humans, continue to photograph, label, transcribe, edit and publish our manuscript material — but it is undeniable that the possibility to access even basic information at unprecedented speeds that once required extensive travel and time-consuming digging is enabling researchers to continue doing the work that we love, only augmented. Ultimately, I agree with Lit’s optimistic conclusion, “It has never been a better time to be studying ancient manuscripts” (291).",

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn his contribution to the 2007 volume Digital Philology and Medieval Texts, Peter Robinson suggests that editions must do all of the following:\n\nPresent a text; Present the different historical forms of the text; Present the differences between the historical forms of the text; Explain the relationship between the different historical forms; Explain how the editor edited; Let the reader test the editor’s methods and conclusions. (“Electronic Editions” 1-2)\n\nHe goes on to argue that print editions are only maybe better than digital editions at doing the first thing: presenting a text. Essentially, digital editions allow us to make editions that are better at creating visualizations, visualizations that enable readers to see what they might otherwise be blind to in a traditional print edition. The editing practices of this dissertation seek to meet Robinson’s criteria:\nThis dissertation embraces recent advancements in digital methods to try to achieve the mandates of the New Philology movement: to treat manuscript witnesses with respect, to foreground textual variance, and to invite readers into the complexity rather than smooth it away. While no single edition can be all things to all readers, this one seeks to align its priorities with the best guidance of digital medievalists working today, and to return to Foulet and Speer’s best advice for editing Old French texts, “In other words, editing is not a science, but an art” (39).",

    "text": "Paolo Radiciotti and Arianna D’Ottone suggest the fragment made its way to the region in the later twelfth-century just prior to the fall of Baldwin IV’s reign over the kingdom of Jerusalem, and although they cannot offer a more concrete origin story, they note that the presence of Old French fragments saved among the other language documents, demonstrates a multicultural respect for sacred texts in the region at that time (58).↩︎\n Gabriele Giannini and Laura Minervini point to the cultural significance of this manuscript’s presence in Damascus, “The small, humble manuscript in which the Old French poem about St. Mary of Egypt was copied was apparently aimed at a different audience: the story of the Egyptian prostitute who chose, after visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, to become a penitent hermit in the Transjordanian desert, had an immediate appeal among Western pilgrims on their way to the holy places. The saint, moreover, was venerated in the Orthodox and Coptic churches, thus representing an element of cultural convergence between the Franks and the local Christians” (346).↩︎\n While most scholars tend to write about the emotional connection we feel to our material manuscripts, Whearty insists on our surrogates’ ability to pull on our heartstrings: “There is no standard for documenting the affective charge behind a digitization. Nevertheless, affect is an important part of this tale. One of the substantial threads running through medievalist-authored commentary on digitization is how affective, sensual connection drives intellectual discovery when working with hard-copy books. Digital manuscripts, in these comparisons, are often held up as lacking that powerful emotional-intellectual resonance … But this opposition denies the ways that affective connection to an analog object can (occasionally) drive a digitization. … All digital manuscripts are made by real people, each with their own intellectual and  affective responses to the objects of their labor. Even in the midst of workflows that emphasize systematic digitization, human elements and human emotions remain.” (Digital Codicology 53; Whearty’s emphasis)↩︎\n Initially, I was discouraged from taking my own pictures of the photographs because of the digitized images available, but after demonstrating the greater clarity my smartphone images provided me and the way in which I could better capture the physical scale of the photographs with my own images, I was permitted to take a few pictures for research purposes before the end of a too-brief visit.↩︎\n Here, I borrow from Bolter and Grusin’s use of the term ‘remediation’ in Remediation: Understanding New Media (1999). They offer multiple definitions of the term, restating its logic in multiple ways, but particularly useful to keep in mind for this chapter they write, “Remediation as the mediation of mediation. Each act of mediation depends on other acts of mediation. Media are continually commenting on, reproducing, and replacing each other, and this process is integral to media. Media need each other in order to function as media at all” (55).↩︎\n “Dig into the network of copying and transformation that binds together the digital copies, with their analog chromolithographic copies, with their  analog manuscript copies, and it becomes clear that there are only copies of copies; each a unique object with its own story to tell about technology, transformation, transmission, and labor, generally uncredited and unseen.” (Digital Codicology xviii; Whearty’s emphasis)↩︎\n&gt; The term ‘ghost’ is often used in relation to digital materials. I discuss its use in more detail below in the section “(Im)material and (In)human.”↩︎\n In The Fluid Text (2002), John Bryant emphasizes the cultural value of perceiving texts as migratory, “What makes a fluid text fluid is its fluidity. This tautology is meant to stress an obvious point easily missed: When we read a fluid text, we are comparing the versions of a text, which is to say we are reading the differences between the versions, which is to say we are reading distance traveled, difference, and change. We are reading the energy of a culture that makes the change, an energy that has measurable meaning in our analysis of culture” (62-63).↩︎\n Stephen G. Nichols criticizes the ‘chain analogy’ of textual transmission: “While it’s true that vernacular works were transmitted longitudinally throughout the Middle Ages, the process was stochastic and contingent, rather than orderly or symmetrical. … We should not be surprised, then, to discover that each manuscript version of a literary work had a story to tell about itself, a story conveying something about the social, economic, and cultural conditions leading to the creation of that particular manuscript and its choice of text(s). Viewed from this perspective, the manuscript is no less dynamic and complex, but the dynamism and complexity are distributed differently” (From Parchment to Cyberspace 57).↩︎\n “Lost books and destroyed files are  the long history of medieval manuscripts” (Digital Codicology 118; Whearty’s emphasis).↩︎\n New Philology (or New Medievalism) gained prominence in the late eighties and early nineties with publications like Bernard Cerquiglini’s Éloge de la variante: Histoire critique de la philologie (1989) and the 1990 January issue of * Speculum*edited by Stephen G. Nichols.↩︎\n&gt; In the third chapter of his &gt; Among Digitized Manuscripts: Philology, Codicology, Paleography in a Digital World &gt; (2020), L.W.C. van Lit assesses twenty digital libraries and claims the BnF and the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin are tied in first place for the quality of their digital repositories (73-101).↩︎\n Even the manuscript researcher’s experience of browsing has changed. In his chapter “Ways of Seeing Manuscripts: Exploring Parker 2.0” featured in Medieval Manuscripts in the Digital Age (2021), Andrew Prescott argues in favor of digital collections, “It is a common lament that e-books deprive us of the pleasure of browsing along the shelf. This may be true of printed books, but manuscript scholars rarely have the opportunity to browse along the shelves of a manuscript collection. A major advantage of having a collection like the Parker Library available in digital form is that it gives us the opportunity to browse and dip into unfamiliar manuscripts. With a digital manuscript library, we can browse through manuscripts in a way that security and conservation considerations otherwise make impossible” (43).↩︎\n Whearty’s Digital Codicology (2022) provides an insightful ethnography on digitization, revealing the complexities and decision-making processes involved in this transformative practice, physically how this work is done, what is prioritized during the process, what data we cling to, and what data we let go of due to various restraints. She reminds us, “Server space is finite. Curation is not the same as hoarding. Not everything can — or should — be saved” (230).↩︎\n “Because of this living variance, manuscripts have become bastions of an intuitive human sense of knowing and thinking that I see as under threat in a world of readily available information” (88).↩︎\n “Fetishism? Indeed, for such reverence affords me a wormhole by which to escape from any utilitarian hegemony that might attempt to mechanize the manuscript matrix…” (90).↩︎\n “Of course, the manuscript has always had this magical nature — it has always taunted the critical edition from an untraversable distance with a complexity irreducible to any systematic editorial plan. But as I read it—slowly, haltingly, with difficulty—under the new powerful banner of mechanized algorithms and text searchability, the manuscript’s humble imperfection erupts before me in a brilliant display of recalcitrant dignity, bathed in a numinous aura of the unknowable” (95).↩︎\n I borrow this phrase “exclusionary gesture” from historian Leonora Neville. During her appearance on the Medieval Institute of the University of Notre Dame’s podcast Meeting in the Middle Ages, Neville commented that necessitating the command of dead medieval languages while discrediting the academic value of editions and translations as gateways into research is an “exclusionary gesture” (00:50:20 - 00:54:14).↩︎\n Whearty highlights the need for a specifically digital codicology to resolve the issue of solely defining digital objects by way of negation: “&gt; Over the past forty years, research in the humanities has been transformed by the digitization of a wide array of cultural heritage objects — including pre- and nonprint medieval texts. As this transformation has occurred, a consensus has emerged concerning what digitized books are &gt; not &gt; — they are not perfect surrogates for or transparent windows to their analog originals. Less ink has been spilled and fewer pixels illuminated concerning what digital manuscripts &gt; are&gt;” (Digital Codicology&gt; 2).↩︎\n Echoing this view, Abigail Robertson argues that the digital manuscript is not a poor substitute, but a powerful complement to its material counterpart: “It is reductive to view the digital manuscript as ‘less than’ or even as a replacement or understudy for the physical object; instead, the digital manuscript ought to be conceived of as a complement to the physical object. This digital complement can certainly ‘replace’ the physical one for those without interest in or access to visiting the material object itself, but the digital complement allows us to study the manuscript in ways that augment the investigation of the physical object” (34).↩︎\n Françoise Vieillard and Olivier Guyotjeannin share this musical comparison in their Conseils pour l’édition des textes médiévaux (2001): “Une cantate de Bach exécuté avec des violons d’époque et un jeune garçon à la place de la soprane, mais dans un auditorium climatisé plutôt que dans une église glaciale éclairée aux bougies, ne sera jamais une reproduction, elle restera une (ré)interprétation. L’éditeur, lui aussi, (ré)interprète ; il tranche des points douteux (et d’ailleurs baisse parfois les bras) ; il donne à lire une nouvelle version de l’œuvre ou de l’acte, à un public dont il faut espérer qu’il dépassera le cercle des spécialistes partageant ses intérêts propres, eux-mêmes ‘datés’ par l’état de la science. Jamais il ne pourra se substituer au manuscrit, au feuillet de parchemin, à ce qu’il entrouve sur la perception des lettres et des mots, des inflexions et des pauses d’une lecture.” (14)↩︎\n Bryant argues that one important purpose of an edition — regardless of its format — is to inspire such engagement, “Finally, both screen and book versions should encourage readers to get into the real world, of which both screen and book are mere facsimiles” (165).↩︎\n As Nafde and Gorst note, access is no longer confined to the privileged few with institutional proximity to elite collections: “Digitizing the manuscripts makes possible not only remote access but also multiple simultaneous access. Now, however, medieval paleography and original transcriptions need not be the purview of a limited number of people located in the golden triangle of Cambridge, Oxford, and London” (149).↩︎\n Lit concedes this point, “Whatever happens, it does seem that digitization has become an unstoppable force and more and more students and scholars are seeking out digitized manuscripts, often preferring them over material manuscripts. At the same time libraries are noticeably making it more difficult or even impossible to see the material manuscript, arguing that the digital surrogate will do. A fair evaluation of the digital materiality of digitized manuscripts is therefore crucial, in order to make use of them in an appropriate manner” (101).↩︎\n “With the advantages and drawbacks to digital ‘surrogacy’ now in sight, researchers today are primed to turn their inquiries about re-production back onto the embodiment of images and texts across bibliographic media — not from manuscript to print (and to pixel), but as them at once.” (Drimmer 107)↩︎\n Whearty offers this more capacious definition, “Accessibility does not just mean putting photographs of manuscripts on the web. Nor should it mean wrapping digital manuscripts exclusively in the jargons of traditional codicology and bibliography. It means surrounding digitized manuscripts with information that can act as a doorway in for new users” (Digital Codicology 202-203).↩︎\n We cannot fully anticipate what future trends will emerge, but as Roman Fritschi suggests, we may be confident that digital access is reshaping the way we work and the questions we are capable of pursuing, “Easy access to manuscript sources will probably shape the way in which medievalists work in the coming years. Not only will the development of suitable tools create new opportunities for digital paleography, but access to extensive collections of digital manuscripts will give rise to new areas of inquiry, which have scarcely been conceivable so far. The easier it becomes to access digital manuscripts, and the simpler it becomes for researchers to use digital manuscripts in their preferred working environments, the greater the interest will be in this type of source” (250).↩︎\n Git is the Version Control System that I have used to track revisions and manage the files of the digital edition in this dissertation. Git is free and open-source software and is currently the most widely used source-code management tool among developers. It allows users to track and document changes to their files over time, and it enables the collaboration of multiple users on a shared project.↩︎\n In his introduction to The Paleography of Gothic Manuscripts(2001), Albert Derolez similarly points to the “present-day crisis of paleography” (2). He argues in favor of implementing quantitative approaches in conjunction with more traditional descriptive methods as a way of disrupting the authoritarian nature of the discipline that would otherwise be dominated by the few elite experts able to gain the ambiguous “paleographer’s eye” (2) over many years of direct contact with manuscripts. Much like print editions, “The method applied hitherto to paleographical handbooks has produced an authoritarian discipline, the pertinence of which depends on the authority of the author and the faith of the reader” (9).↩︎\n In Part 1 (“A Historical Orientation”) of their guide On Editing Old French Texts (1979), Alfred Foulet and Mary Speer describe the “crisis of confidence” (19-28) that has essentially been in effect since Joseph Bédier published his new edition of the* Lai de l’Ombre* in 1913, which cast doubt on the former Lachmannian method. Bédier essentially advised that editors be governed by an attitude of both distrust in oneself and trust in the medieval scribe, altering the text of the manuscript as little as possible and only making corrections in some appendix (Speer “Old French Literature” 397-398). In 1995, Mary Speer concluded, “In Old French editing, there are no mechanical systems, and there will likely be no definitive editions, only renewed attempts to represent in a convenient format for a particular audience an approximation of what the editor defines as the truth (or truths) about a certain text” (“Old French Literature” 404).↩︎\n “Une fois ses décisions prises, il doit les appliquer avec cohérence et mettre le lecteur en état de juger de la méthode suivie** **: il ne devra jamais hésiter à exposer et justifier en note, et éventuellement dans l’introduction, les choix opérés” (18).↩︎\n “Den Text von Damascus gebe ich ohne alle Zutat, nur daß ich j und i, v und u sondere und ein paar fehlende Buchstaben einschalte” (Tobler 967). Though he follows standard editing practices, arguably Tobler does more than add a few missing letters. In 27 of the 38 lines of this fragment, he adds letters and spaces to expand scribal abbreviations, to regularize word spacing, and to fill in for physical gaps in the fragment, but most of these additions are not made totally clear to the reader. In this print edition, the reader is not able to determine what has been added by the editor and what is actually present in the material source.↩︎\n I describe these editing methods in detail in Chapter 2 of this dissertation.↩︎\n The fear that machines will replace human scholars often conceals a more personal discomfort: a reluctance to adapt, to learn new tools, and to alter familiar workflows. Lit pushes manuscript scholars to push themselves outside of their comfort zones but insists it is not necessary to master it all, “The two most important lessons to draw from this and the previous chapters are that technology only remains as powerful as the user wielding it and that we do not need to know everything — just those aspects that help us build a solution. This is why it is very important to keep an open and creative mind” (226).↩︎\n While Bolter and Grusin see the promise of ‘immediacy’ supposedly offered by digital media as a problematic illusion (Remediation 45-46), they nevertheless acknowledge that new forms of media arise due to the shortcomings of previous forms of media: “Each new medium is justified because it fills a lack or repairs a fault in its predecessor, because it fulfills the unkept promise of an older medium. (Typically, of course, users did not realize that the older medium had failed in its promise until the new one appeared.)” (60).↩︎\n &gt; “Obviously, editors fear leaving behind the security offered by a printable version. This is a moment of transition. … All textual witnesses and all variant readings have equal rights and equal chances to be represented, and the choice belongs to readers” (20).↩︎\n &gt; “The illusion of the existence of a text as a definable and stable entity disappears: meaning is constantly being created and recreated during the complex process of reading, in the minds of individual readers and through their cooperation, just as it happened in the monasteries, &gt; studia&gt; , and universities of the Middle Ages” (Kiss et al 30).↩︎\n Skeptical of the argument that &gt; digital surrogates have the potential to more closely mirror medieval modes of reading, Heather Bamford and Emily Francomano caution “…as digital philologists, we should be aware that we are creating, not reproducing or straightforwardly representing, manuscript cultures. We should also acknowledge that while we may share some aspects of medieval manuscript culture with historical medieval readers and writers, they had no analogous experience of the digital environments medievalists inhabit today. What we are doing is a sort of virtual neomedievalism, a learned, creative anachronism. If we are willing to entertain the notion that there is such a thing as digital-medieval manuscript culture, then, our practice as its creators and transmitters should be transparent, in short, recognized as the multitemporal remediation that it is” (41).↩︎\n “For the last two hundred years or so, medieval literary works have been subject to the mediation of text editors. The public at large could read medieval literature in editions, or in translations based upon them. And, in consequence, they saw only the verbal text, since that’s what text editors considered essential. … For what the critical edition has provided all these years is an ideal version of a poetic work that — like God in medieval theology — exists everywhere in its manuscript exemplars, and nowhere as an independent entity. In the spirit of Voltaire’s mot  about God, since the work couldn’t be definitely located, scholars had to invent it. For as long as the manuscripts were scattered in rare book repositories all over the world, that was fine. Better to have an ideal work, than nothing. But now that we can see and study a whole series of authentic manuscript versions of the work we need to rethink the relationship between the manuscripts and our definition (and understanding) of ‘the medieval literary work’” (From Parchment to Cyberspace 198-199).↩︎\n&gt; Nichols’s ‘mutable stability’ is an echo of Paul Zumthor’s earlier theorization of ‘&gt; mouvance’&gt; in which a medieval text is a complex unit constituted by the collection of its many material (written) and immaterial (oral) versions, “L’œuvre est fondamentalement mouvante” (73).↩︎\n Bryant affirms the ability of the ‘fluid text’ edition to connect modern readers to a time different from their own: “…readers will no longer take the text as ‘timeless’ and hence allow it to become merely a reflection of their immediate, idiosyncratic sensibility; rather, they will begin to see the mutable aesthetic object as a function of a past that is both alien to and yet potentially inclusive of themselves. This automatic distancing between text and reader heightens the historicity of the reading experience” (124).↩︎",

For at that time in that realm, 162no man ever saw a more beautiful woman. Never countess nor queen had over her brow more beautiful hair. She had round ears. What’s more, they were marvelously white, 167her eyes bright and smiling, her eyebrows black and becoming, her small mouth well-proportioned, and pleasing her expression, her face tender and blushing 172like the rose that has just bloomed. Indeed neither on her nose nor on her chin 335vbwould you notice any defect. On top of that, her neck was white like ermine. There flowed her blonde hair. 177The breasts of this lady were no smaller than apples. Below her throat on her chest, it was white like a hawthorn flower. She had white arms and white hands, 182her fingers shapely, slender, and smooth. She had a fine body and well molded from her underarm along her side. She was neither too big nor too small. Her frame could never be written. 187The beauty of this lady could never be written by any man. She was so courteous of speech; there was nothing to improve. Such a creature makes one lament 192when she does not care about the Creator. She received many presents and bought herself good garments. She had good and fitting clothes to better please her lovers. 197She did not care for woollen cloth. On the worst day of the week, she had a fine purple silk bliaut and adorned herself with an ermine mantle. Well-painted shoes of Cordovan leather 202she wore all the days of the year. The citizens of the city loved her entirely for her beauty. The aged men and the wise would all say, “God, what a shame! 207Oh alas evermore for this sufferer! There is much to bemoan of her youth. Oh alas evermore for her life as it is so full of folly.” Everyone in the city would say 212that she was of high parentage for she answered all with reason 336raand had such a beautiful frame that the son of an emperor could have taken her with great honor. ….. 338vaShe went so long by day and by night, hungry and thirsty and on hard beds. There she was so deep in the wood that she became entirely wild, but she never forgot 618to pray to saint Mary. Often, she remembered the image on which she had made her pledge. Soon, her shoes were worn out, and soon, her clothes were all torn up. 623Her body was left totally naked. She did not have clothing that was not in tatters. Her own flesh changed color, that which before was white like a flower. From winter as from summer, 628her sides blackened entirely. The color of her blonde hair changed. It turned white like an ermine. Her mouth was thinned, and all around it blackened, 633and her chin was so black as though it were tainted with charcoal. Thinned were her eyes. There was not a shred of pride there now. If you saw her ears, 638it would appear to you a great marvel for they were black and cracked. Her white flesh changed entirely Black and changed was her chest. It seemed like thorny bark. 643There was no more flesh in her breasts, no more than there is in a glove. Her arms, her hands, and her long fingers were blacker than any pitch. She had long and large nails. 648She reshaped them with her teeth. Her stomach was sunken. She put little provisions in there. Her feet were split. In many places, they were wounded 338vbfor she did not protect herself from thorns as she went through the wilderness. It seemed to her, in her mind, she was not wrong about this at all, that one of her sins fell away 658when a thorn pricked her. For this, she was so pleased as she suffered hardship. It was no marvel that she was blackened for she led such a severe life. 663After more than forty years in the nude, it was no marvel she was woolly. She had poor provisions with her. Pray, may Jesus have mercy on her. She had two loaves of no great size. 668On these, she lived for many years. In the first year, they became hard as though they were building stones. Each day, Mary ate some, but this was a small portion. 673As soon as she had eaten up all her bread, then she plucked the grass of the field. Like other beasts she ate it. None of this bothered her. On her hands, she drank the water from the stream 678as she had no other vessel. She does not bemoan her sins as her body is so chastised. On grass she lived and on roots for seventeen years in the wilderness. 683Then for thirty years, she ate nothing unless an angel brought it to her. In the first year, the devil often used to tempt her, making her remember all 688that she used to always love: the good eats and the fine places where she was used to playing games. Now, she felt so blessed that she had forgotten all. 339raNever then in all her life did she think more of folly. Never in all the wood did any wild beast come to her thereafter nor any other living creature. 698Through the forest, she goes completely safe. In many places, she took shelter. Her life was entirely spiritual. …..",

In this world or in this realm, 154no man ever saw a more beautiful woman. Never did a duchess or a queen have on her head more beautiful hair. She had round ears. What’s more, they were marvelously white, 159her eyebrows black and becoming, and her eyes bright and smiling, her face tender and covered like the rose that has only just bloomed. Her teeth were white and quite small. 164A more beautiful mouth no one ever saw. She had such a pleasing expression, and her look and her features bright. I believe on her nose and on her chin there was no defect at all. 169Below her mouth on her chest, it was whiter than a hawthorn flower, and of course she had beautiful breasts, very well set, small, and beautiful. She had white arms and white hands, 174and her fingers slender, long, and smooth. 110vShe had a fine body and was well molded beneath her underarm and her side. She was so courteous of speech; there was nothing to improve. 179She was neither too big nor too small. Her frame could never be described. The beauty of these proportions could not be described without praise. Such a creature makes one lament 184when she does not care about her Creator. She received great presents and bought herself expensive garments. She had good and fitting clothes to better please her lovers, 189and she did not wear woollen cloth. On the worst day of the week, she wore a fine purple silk bliaut and adorned herself with an ermine mantle. Well-painted shoes of Cordovan leather 194she wore all the days of the year. The citizens of the city loved her entirely for her beauty, and the old men and the wise would all say, “God, what a shame! 199Oh alas for this sufferer! There is much to bemoan of her youth. Alas evermore for her life, which is so full of folly.” As she answered all with reason 204and had such a beautiful frame, that the son of an emperor could have taken her with honor. ….. 567She roamed so long by night and by day, hungry, thirsty, and on hard beds. There she was in the wood so long that she became entirely wild. Soon, her clothes were worn out, 572and soon, her soles were torn up. As much from winter as from summer, her sides blackened entirely. Her tender flesh changed color, which before was white like a flower. 577The color of her beautiful hair changed. It turned white like the ermine. Under that, her face was burned from the sun and from the frost. 114rHer mouth was thinned, 582and her flesh around it blackened, and her chin was so black as if it were the head of a firebrand. Thinned were her eyes. There was not a shred of pride there now. 587If you saw her ears, it would occur to you a great marvel for they were so skinny and deteriorated and all woolly with white hairs. Black and hairy was her chest. 592It seemed like black thorny bark. Her stomach was all sunken. She ate nothing and so that was right. She had large nails. She reshaped them with her teeth. 597Her feet were skinny and split, and, in many places, were deeply wounded for she did not protect them from thorns as she went through the wilderness. So it seemed to her, in her mind, 602and she was not wrong about this at all, as a thorn pricked her, one of her sins fell down from her. She does not bemoan her sins as her body is so chastised. 607It was no marvel that she was woolly; for forty years, she went totally nude. She had two loaves of no great size. On these, she lived for many years. The first year they became hard 612as though they were building stone. Every day, Mary ate some, but this was a very poor life. As soon as she had eaten up all her bread, then she plucked the grasses of the fields 617Like other beasts, she ate them. None of this bothered her. From then on, she drank from the stream. She had no other vessel. On grasses she lived and on roots 622for eighteen years in the wilderness. Then for twenty years, she only ate what the angel of God brought to her. The devil came before her first. He used to annoy her so much, 627making her remember whatever she once used to love: the fine delights and the fine games in which she used to take pleasure. She felt so blessed 632when she had forgotten all of this. Never again in her life did she remember a day of folly. Mary goes through the wood. Never did she see a wild beast 637nor any living creature. Through the forest, she goes in all security. 114vIn many places, she was sheltered. Her life was spiritual. …..",

At that time, there was no woman so beautiful 164for she was a gem above them all. Never countess nor queen had on her head such beautiful hair. She had round ears. They were very marvelously white, 38vher eyebrows black and becoming, and her eyes bright and overjoyed, her small mouth well-proportioned, and she had a simple expression, her face tender and blushing 174like a rose that has just bloomed. Indeed neither on her nose nor on her chin would you notice any defect. On top of that, her neck was white like ermine. There flowed her blonde hair. 179Each of the breasts of the lady was no bigger than an apple. Below her throat on her chest, it was white like a hawthorn flower. She had long arms and white hands, 184her fingers shapely, slender, and smooth. She had a fine body and was well molded from her underarm along her side. She was neither too big nor too small. Her frame could never be described. 189Nor could the beauty of this lady ever be described by any soul. She was so courteous of speech; there was nothing to improve. Such a creature makes one lament 194when she does not care about her Creator. 39rShe received many presents and bought herself beautiful garments. She had good and fitting clothes to better please her lovers. 199She did not care for woollen cloth. On any of the days of the week, she wore, instead, a bliaut of fine purple silk and adorned herself with an ermine mantle. Well-painted shoes of Cordovan leather, 204she wore all the days of the year. Every man of the city loved her for her beauty. The aged men and the wise would say, “Ah! What a shame! 209Oh alas was born the sufferer! There is much to bemoan of her youth. Alas evermore for her life as it is so full of folly.” Everyone in the city would say 214that she was of great parentage for she answered all with reason and had such a beautiful frame that the son of an emperor could have taken her with great honor. ….. 623She went so long in the day as in the night, hungry, thirsty, and on hard beds. There she was so deep in the wood that she became entirely wild, but she never forgot 628to pray to saint Mary. Often, she remembered the image on which she had made her pledge. Soon, her clothes were worn out, and soon, her soles were stripped. 633As her clothes were in tatters, her body was left totally naked. Her own flesh changed color, that which before was white like a flower. 47vFrom the winter and from the summer 638her sides blackened entirely. The color of her blonde hair changed. It turned white like ermine. Her face was burned by the blazing sun and by the frost. 643Her mouth was thinned and all around it blackened, and her chin was so black it was like the head of a firebrand. Tinted and blackened were her eyes. 648There was not any pride there now. If you saw her ears, it would be a great marvel to you for they were skinny and cracked and all woolly with white hairs. 653Black and woolly was her chest. It seemed like thorny bark. She had no more flesh in her breast, no more than there is in a glove. Her arms, her hands, and her long fingers 658were blacker than any pitch. She had such large nails. So she reshaped them with her teeth. Her stomach was all sunken. She hardly ate, so that was right. 48rHer feet were split. In many places, they were wounded for she did not protect herself from thorns as she went through the wilderness. It seemed to her, in her mind, 668for truly, about this, she was not wrong at all, that one of her sins fell away when a thorn pricked her. For this, she was so pleased. As she suffered such hardship, 673it was no wonder that she was blackened for she led such a severe life. After more than forty years in the nude, it was no wonder she was woolly. She had poor provisions with her. 678Pray, may Jesus have mercy on her. She had two loaves of no great size. On these she sustained herself for many years. They all became hard in the first year as though they were made from a wall. 683Each day, Mary ate some, but this was a small portion. As soon as she had eaten up her bread, then she gathered the grass of the field. Like other beasts she ate it. 688None of this bothered her. 48vProne, she drew from a stream. Like so, she drank. She had no other vessel. She does not bemoan her sins as her body was so chastised. 693On grass she lived and on roots for eighteen years in the wilderness. Then for thirty years, she never ate but what the angel of God brought to her. Devils came to approach her. 698Often, they used to tempt her, making her remember all that she once used to love: the good eats and the fine places where she was used to playing her games. 703Now, she felt so blessed that nothing hurt her. Never, in all her life, did she think, then, of folly. Nor, then, in all the wood, 708did she see wild beasts at all. nor any other living creature. Through the forest, she goes totally sure. In many places, she takes shelter. Her life is entirely spiritual. …..",

At that time and in that realm, 162there was never a more beautiful woman. Never countess nor queen had on her head more beautiful hair. She had round ears, and they were marvelously white, 167her eyebrows black and becoming, and her eyes sparkling and joyful, her mouth beautiful and well-proportioned, and pleasing her expression, her face tender and blushing 172like a freshly-bloomed rose. Indeed neither on her nose nor on her chin might you perceive any defect. Her neck was white like ermine. Long was her blonde hair. 177Not a bit bigger than an apple was either of the breasts of this lady. Below her mouth on her chest, it was as white as a hawthorn flower. She had white arms and white hands, 182her fingers shapely, slender, and smooth. She had a fine body and was well molded from her underarm along her side. Neither too big nor too small, her frame could never be described. 187The great beauty of this lady could not be written fully by any man. She was so courteous of speech; there was nothing to improve. Such a creature makes one lament 192when she does not care about her Creator. She received great presents, and bought herself beautiful garments. She had beautiful and fitting clothes to please her lovers well. 197She did not care for woollen cloth. On the worst day of the week, she wore a fine purple silk bliaut and adorned herself with an ermine mantle. 114rdWell-painted shoes of Cordovan leather, 202she wore all the days of the year. The citizens of the city loved her entirely for her beauty. The aged men and the wise all would say that it was a shame. 207“Oh alas for this sufferer! There is much to bemoan of her youth. Alas evermore for her life as it is so full of folly.” Everyone in the city would say 212that she was of high parentage for she answered all with reason and had such a beautiful frame. The son of an emperor could have taken her with honor. ….. 613She went so long by day and by night, through woods, through plains, and through hills, and so deeply she went into the wood that she became entirely wild there, but she never forgot 618to pray to saint Mary. Often, she remembered the image on which she had made her pledge. Soon, her clothes were worn out, and soon, her soles were stripped. 623As her clothes were in tatters, her body was left totally naked. Her own flesh changed color. Before, it was white like a flower. In winter as in summer, 628her sides blackened entirely. Her blonde hair changed greatly. It turned white like an ermine from the sun and from the frost. Her face was so burned. 633Her mouth was thinned, and her flesh around it blackened. Her chin was so black. It was like the head of a firebrand. All black were her eyes now. 638She had, now, not a shred of pride. If you saw her ears, it would occur to you a great marvel that was skinny and cracked and all woolly with white hairs. 643Black and woolly was her chest. It so resembled thorny bark. She did not have flesh in her breasts, nothing more than there is in a glove. Her arms, her hands, and her long fingers 648were blacker than pitch. She had such large nails on her slicing teeth she made them round. 115vaHer stomach was sunken for she had none of her delights. 653Her feet were split and wounded all over. She did not protect herself from thorns as she went through the wilderness. It seemed to her, in her mind, 658that it would do little or no good for as a thorn pricked her in one of her feet, it would fall away. For this, she was so pleased. As she bore great hardship, 663it was no wonder she was blackened for she led a very severe life. After more than forty years in the nude, it was no wonder she was woolly. She had poor provisions with her. 668May God have mercy on her. She had two loaves of no great size. On these she lived for many years. The first year, they became hard as though they were building stones. 673Each day, Mary ate some, but this was a small portion. As soon as she had eaten up all her bread, then she gathered the grass of the field. Like other beasts, she ate it. 678None of this bothered her. Prone, she drank from the stream for there was no other vessel. She does not bemoan her sins as her body is so chastised. 683On grass she lived and on roots for seventeen years in the wilderness. Then, for thirty years, she ate only what the angel of God brought to her. The devil came to her first. 688Often, he used to tempt her, making her remember all that she once used to love: the fine delights and the fine places where she was used to playing her games. 693Now, she felt blessed as she had forgotten all of this before long. Then for all her life, she never thought of folly. Never in all the wood 698did she see any wild beasts at all nor any other living creature. Through the forest, she goes utterly naked. 115vbIn many places, she took shelter. Her life was spiritual. …..",

In this world or in this realm, 154no man ever saw a more beautiful woman. Never did a duchess or a queen have on her head more beautiful hair. She had round ears. What’s more, they were marvelously white, 159her eyebrows black and becoming, and her eyes bright and smiling, her face tender and covered like the rose that has only just bloomed. Her teeth were white and quite small. 164A more beautiful mouth no one ever saw. She had such a pleasing expression, and her look and her features bright. I believe on her nose and on her chin there was no defect at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n169Below her mouth on her chest, it was whiter than a hawthorn flower, and of course she had beautiful breasts, very well set, small, and beautiful. She had white arms and white hands, 174and her fingers slender, long, and smooth. 110vShe had a fine body and was well molded beneath her underarm and her side. She was so courteous of speech; there was nothing to improve. 179She was neither too big nor too small. Her frame could never be described. The beauty of these proportions could not be described without praise. Such a creature makes one lament 184when she does not care about her Creator. She received great presents and bought herself expensive garments. She had good and fitting clothes to better please her lovers, 189and she did not wear woollen cloth. On the worst day of the week, she wore a fine purple silk bliaut and adorned herself with an ermine mantle. Well-painted shoes of Cordovan leather 194she wore all the days of the year. The citizens of the city loved her entirely for her beauty, and the old men and the wise would all say, “God, what a shame! 199Oh alas for this sufferer! There is much to bemoan of her youth. Alas evermore for her life, which is so full of folly.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs she answered all with reason 204and had such a beautiful frame, that the son of an emperor could have taken her with honor. ….. 567She roamed so long by night and by day, hungry, thirsty, and on hard beds. There she was in the wood so long that she became entirely wild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon, her clothes were worn out, 572and soon, her soles were torn up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs much from winter as from summer, her sides blackened entirely. Her tender flesh changed color, which before was white like a flower. 577The color of her beautiful hair changed. It turned white like the ermine. Under that, her face was burned from the sun and from the frost. 114rHer mouth was thinned, 582and her flesh around it blackened, and her chin was so black as if it were the head of a firebrand. Thinned were her eyes. There was not a shred of pride there now. 587If you saw her ears, it would occur to you a great marvel for they were so skinny and deteriorated and all woolly with white hairs. Black and hairy was her chest. 592It seemed like black thorny bark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer stomach was all sunken. She ate nothing and so that was right. She had large nails. She reshaped them with her teeth. 597Her feet were skinny and split, and, in many places, were deeply wounded for she did not protect them from thorns as she went through the wilderness. So it seemed to her, in her mind, 602and she was not wrong about this at all, as a thorn pricked her, one of her sins fell down from her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe does not bemoan her sins as her body is so chastised. 607It was no marvel that she was woolly; for forty years, she went totally nude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe had two loaves of no great size. On these, she lived for many years. The first year they became hard 612as though they were building stone. Every day, Mary ate some, but this was a very poor life. As soon as she had eaten up all her bread, then she plucked the grasses of the fields 617Like other beasts, she ate them. None of this bothered her. From then on, she drank from the stream. She had no other vessel. On grasses she lived and on roots 622for eighteen years in the wilderness. Then for twenty years, she only ate what the angel of God brought to her. The devil came before her first. He used to annoy her so much, 627making her remember whatever she once used to love: the fine delights and the fine games in which she used to take pleasure. She felt so blessed 632when she had forgotten all of this. Never again in her life did she remember a day of folly. Mary goes through the wood. Never did she see a wild beast 637nor any living creature. Through the forest, she goes in all security. 114vIn many places, she was sheltered. Her life was spiritual. …..",

At that time, there was no woman so beautiful 164for she was a gem above them all. Never countess nor queen had on her head such beautiful hair. She had round ears. They were very marvelously white, 38vher eyebrows black and becoming, and her eyes bright and overjoyed, her small mouth well-proportioned, and she had a simple expression, her face tender and blushing 174like a rose that has just bloomed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed neither on her nose nor on her chin would you notice any defect. On top of that, her neck was white like ermine. There flowed her blonde hair. 179Each of the breasts of the lady was no bigger than an apple. Below her throat on her chest, it was white like a hawthorn flower. She had long arms and white hands, 184her fingers shapely, slender, and smooth. She had a fine body and was well molded from her underarm along her side. She was neither too big nor too small. Her frame could never be described. 189Nor could the beauty of this lady ever be described by any soul. She was so courteous of speech; there was nothing to improve. Such a creature makes one lament 194when she does not care about her Creator. 39rShe received many presents and bought herself beautiful garments. She had good and fitting clothes to better please her lovers. 199She did not care for woollen cloth. On any of the days of the week, she wore, instead, a bliaut of fine purple silk and adorned herself with an ermine mantle. Well-painted shoes of Cordovan leather, 204she wore all the days of the year. Every man of the city loved her for her beauty. The aged men and the wise would say, “Ah! What a shame! 209Oh alas was born the sufferer! There is much to bemoan of her youth. Alas evermore for her life as it is so full of folly.” Everyone in the city would say 214that she was of great parentage for she answered all with reason and had such a beautiful frame that the son of an emperor could have taken her with great honor. ….. 623She went so long in the day as in the night, hungry, thirsty, and on hard beds. There she was so deep in the wood that she became entirely wild, but she never forgot 628to pray to saint Mary. Often, she remembered the image on which she had made her pledge. Soon, her clothes were worn out, and soon, her soles were stripped. 633As her clothes were in tatters, her body was left totally naked. Her own flesh changed color, that which before was white like a flower. 47vFrom the winter and from the summer 638her sides blackened entirely. The color of her blonde hair changed. It turned white like ermine. Her face was burned by the blazing sun and by the frost. 643Her mouth was thinned and all around it blackened, and her chin was so black it was like the head of a firebrand. Tinted and blackened were her eyes. 648There was not any pride there now. If you saw her ears, it would be a great marvel to you for they were skinny and cracked and all woolly with white hairs. 653Black and woolly was her chest. It seemed like thorny bark. She had no more flesh in her breast, no more than there is in a glove. Her arms, her hands, and her long fingers 658were blacker than any pitch. She had such large nails. So she reshaped them with her teeth. Her stomach was all sunken. She hardly ate, so that was right. 48rHer feet were split. In many places, they were wounded for she did not protect herself from thorns as she went through the wilderness. It seemed to her, in her mind, 668for truly, about this, she was not wrong at all, that one of her sins fell away when a thorn pricked her. For this, she was so pleased. As she suffered such hardship, 673it was no wonder that she was blackened for she led such a severe life. After more than forty years in the nude, it was no wonder she was woolly. She had poor provisions with her. 678Pray, may Jesus have mercy on her. She had two loaves of no great size. On these she sustained herself for many years. They all became hard in the first year as though they were made from a wall. 683Each day, Mary ate some, but this was a small portion. As soon as she had eaten up her bread, then she gathered the grass of the field. Like other beasts she ate it. 688None of this bothered her. 48vProne, she drew from a stream. Like so, she drank. She had no other vessel. She does not bemoan her sins as her body was so chastised. 693On grass she lived and on roots for eighteen years in the wilderness. Then for thirty years, she never ate but what the angel of God brought to her. Devils came to approach her. 698Often, they used to tempt her, making her remember all that she once used to love: the good eats and the fine places where she was used to playing her games. 703Now, she felt so blessed that nothing hurt her. Never, in all her life, did she think, then, of folly. Nor, then, in all the wood, 708did she see wild beasts at all. nor any other living creature. Through the forest, she goes totally sure. In many places, she takes shelter. Her life is entirely spiritual. …..",

Before, it was white like a flower. In winter as in summer, 628her sides blackened entirely. Her blonde hair changed greatly. It turned white like an ermine from the sun and from the frost. Her face was so burned. 633Her mouth was thinned, and her flesh around it blackened. Her chin was so black. It was like the head of a firebrand. All black were her eyes now. 638She had, now, not a shred of pride. If you saw her ears, it would occur to you a great marvel that was skinny and cracked and all woolly with white hairs. 643Black and woolly was her chest. It so resembled thorny bark. She did not have flesh in her breasts, nothing more than there is in a glove. Her arms, her hands, and her long fingers 648were blacker than pitch. She had such large nails on her slicing teeth she made them round. 115vaHer stomach was sunken for she had none of her delights. 653Her feet were split and wounded all over. She did not protect herself from thorns as she went through the wilderness. It seemed to her, in her mind, 658that it would do little or no good for as a thorn pricked her in one of her feet, it would fall away. For this, she was so pleased. As she bore great hardship, 663it was no wonder she was blackened for she led a very severe life. After more than forty years in the nude, it was no wonder she was woolly. She had poor provisions with her. 668May God have mercy on her. She had two loaves of no great size. On these she lived for many years. The first year, they became hard as though they were building stones. 673Each day, Mary ate some, but this was a small portion. As soon as she had eaten up all her bread, then she gathered the grass of the field. Like other beasts, she ate it. 678None of this bothered her. Prone, she drank from the stream for there was no other vessel. She does not bemoan her sins as her body is so chastised. 683On grass she lived and on roots for seventeen years in the wilderness. Then, for thirty years, she ate only what the angel of God brought to her. The devil came to her first. 688Often, he used to tempt her, making her remember all that she once used to love: the fine delights and the fine places where she was used to playing her games. 693Now, she felt blessed as she had forgotten all of this before long. Then for all her life, she never thought of folly. Never in all the wood 698did she see any wild beasts at all nor any other living creature. Through the forest, she goes utterly naked. 115vbIn many places, she took shelter. Her life was spiritual. …..",

    "text": "The Corpus of Version T Manuscripts5\nThere are, in all, eight known manuscripts of Version T, including two fragments:\nT-A: Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France (hereafter BnF), Français 23112, ff.334v-344r. Late 13th century, provenance pre-17th century unknown.\nT-B: Oxford, Bodleian, Canonici Miscellaneous 74, ff.109r-120r. Early 13th century, provenance pre-18th century unknown.\nT-C: Oxford, Corpus Christi College, 232, ff.35r-64v. Early 14th century, from Canterbury.\nT-D: Paris, BnF, Français 19525, ff.15r-26v. Second half of 13th century, from Oxford.\nT-E: Paris, BnF, Arsenal, 3516, ff.113v-117v. 1267/1268, from Artois.\nT-L: London, British Library, Additional 36614, ff.271v-282v. Second half of 13th century, provenance pre-19th century unknown.\nT-F1: Manchester, John Rylands Library, French 6, ff.8r-8v. Second half of 13th century, provenance pre-19th century unknown.\nT-F2: The location of the original fragment — dated to the second half of the 12th century and most likely originating in Europe — is unknown, but a photographic copy may be found here:\nFor the most part, these manuscripts are legendaries containing the Lives of numerous other saints and other texts of religious interest, though there are some exceptions, such as T-L, which pairs the Life of Mary the Egyptian with a compilation of texts centered on Chrétien de Troyes’s Perceval. The distribution of these manuscripts is primarily centered in France and the UK, with three manuscripts housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), two at the University of Oxford, one in the John Rylands in Manchester, and one in the British Library (BL) in London. The only known records of the smallest fragment of Version T, T-F2, are located in the Staatsbibliothek of Berlin.\nNone of the T manuscripts have exact dates or places of origin, but the date range of this set of manuscripts spans from the second half of the twelfth century to the early fourteenth century, with most (T-A, T-D, T-L, and T-F1) landing somewhere in the second half of the thirteenth century. The earliest suggested dating among these manuscripts is for T-F2, and T-C is considered the latest copy. The provenance of a few (T-C, T-D, and T-E) have been more precisely localized, but based on their linguistic and paleographic characteristics, we can comfortably say that the manuscripts of this corpus — with the possible exception of the now lost T-F2 fragment whose provenance is more obscure — originate geographically from the area spanning northern France and southern England.\nThe physical size of these manuscripts vary. The largest manuscript in this corpus both by height and width and by the number of its parchment folios is T-E. T-A, T-E, and T-L are each about the size of a coffee table book, while the smallest manuscript (excluding the fragmentary copies) by its height and width is T-B, which is about the size of a mass market paperback novel, and the smallest by its folio count is T-C, making this copy similar in size to a DVD case. At 225x155mm, T-D is a larger but still quite portable size, similar to most modern hardcover bestsellers. The height and width of fragment T-F1 is 275x190mm — about the size of the average iPad —, but it offers only one folio containing Version T bound together with other fragmentary texts to form a thin volume. The lost fragment T-F2 likewise only offers one full leaf of Version T, but its dimensions were exceptionally small, measuring only 70x50mm — or about the size of a matchbox. In comparing these manuscripts to more familiar modern day objects, I do not intend to assign any particular value to these codices based on their size. Rather, I wish to draw attention to a physical aspect that can be too easily overlooked in traditional catalog descriptions, and which may greatly inform our understanding of these objects by giving us basic evidence as to who read them, in what context they were read, and for what function they served.6\nAmong the T manuscripts, there are no images — neither miniatures nor historiated initials — to be found. Only copy T-E would have included a miniature (approximately 80x65mm) of Mary the Egyptian — most likely depicting the scene in which Zozimas gives her his cloak, based on the surviving miniatures from manuscripts containing other versions of the Vie —,7 but this image has been lost due to the mutilation of the manuscript.\nIn terms of accessibility, at time of writing, five of the manuscript copies of T have been digitized and are freely accessible online to anyone with an internet connection. These are T-A, T-D, T-E, T-F1, and T-F2. Two of these, though, are not available in color as T-A’s digitized copy was produced from its black and white microfilm and T-F2’s online copy is a digitization of the photographic reproduction of the lost fragment. The only T manuscripts that have not been digitized are all located in the UK. These are T-B, T-C, and T-L.8 Four of the T manuscripts (T-A, T-C, T-D, and T-E) are available at their respective libraries on microfilm, and there is also a microform copy of T-L available at the Van Pelt Library at the University of Pennsylvania.9 Taken together, all of this means that T-B is the only Version T copy whose full contents may only be considered in person in the reading room.10 While the availability of these manuscripts varies — from in-person consultation to digitized copies or microfilm — this appendix consolidates and contextualizes the scattered information about this corpus in one place, adding particular aspects of the manuscripts that have either not been discussed or systematically treated elsewhere. By preserving and synthesizing these details, this appendix supplements existing modes of access, offering a comprehensive resource for understanding the extant material record of Version T.",

    "text": "T-A\n\nParis, BnF, Français 23112. ff.334v-344r. Late 13th century, provenance pre-17th century unknown.\nThis manuscript, housed at the Richelieu site of the BnF, is a late thirteenth-century codex comprised of 344 parchment folios with some additional front and back laid paper pages.11 The manuscript’s exact provenance before the seventeenth century is not known, but it is known to have been in the possession of Cardinal Richelieu, as noted in the BnF’s online catalog description and confirmed by Ginguené, who mentions that the manuscript was one of those given to the Sorbonne by Richelieu.12 The stamp of the Bibliothèque de Sorbonne may be seen in the bottom right corner of f.1r. Following the prayer written in rhyming couplets that concludes this manuscript,13 there is a date offered on f.344v — written within the text block and in the same hand as the scribe — reading “Explicit iste liber / anno d[o]m[ini] M CC”, but according to the online BnF catalog, “Cette date ne paraît pas être celle de la transcription du manuscrit, dont l’écriture présente tous les caractères du XIIIe siècle.”14\nThe scribe who copied the text of Marie has not been identified, but the manuscript is written in a dialect that includes some Picard elements, such as the use of “le” for the feminine singular article and “jou” as a variant spelling of “je.”15 The scribe carefully avoided the medieval sewing repairs in the parchment when copying, and the writing on each page begins above the top ruling line, which supports the dating of this manuscript to the thirteenth century. The line breaks on each page respect the verse structure of each text. For each line, there is initial letter separation with all of the initial letters of each line written in majuscule and all other letters of the text block written in minuscule. In terms of glosses, the manuscript contains minor corrections throughout, added by a hand other than the original scribe. These corrections combined with the careful formatting of the text throughout the codex suggest that the manuscript was carefully prepared for the purpose of reading.\nThe codex contains a total of sixty-three texts, including, of course, Version T of La vie de sainte Marie L’Égyptienne, which is the last text in this collection and is preceded by a Life of Catherine of Alexandria. Français 23112 offers 1,526 verses of T without any significant lacunae — making it the most complete of the thirteenth-century copies — and serves as the base copy for Dembowski’s edition.16 In his description, Dembowski offers this short list of other contents in this manuscript: “Il contient aussi une partie du Poème moral, li Livres de la mort (en vers) attribué à Helinand, l’Aventure au chevalier (en vers) et li Miracles du clerc de Roem (en vers) attribué à Thibaut de Vornon, en tout 63 morceaux” (25). Among the many saints’ Lives included in this manuscript, we also find that of another penitent saint from Egypt: Saint Thaïs. The Life of Mary the Egyptian is introduced in the first column of f.334v by the red-ink rubric “Chi [com]mence le vie de marie egyptiene,” and it concludes in the first column of f.344r with the explicit “De nos ames au jugem[en]t. Am[en].” Folio 344 has been cut along its bottom outer corner, resulting in the loss of some text from the manuscript’s concluding prayer, but this damage does not interfere with the Life of Mary the Egyptian.\nThe overall dimensions of the manuscript are 325x230mm, with a writing space of 240x175mm on each page. The text is arranged in two columns per page, with each column measuring 79mm in width and typically containing 40 lines of text, most of which have an average line height of 6mm. There is no visible pricking on the folios, and the pencil ruling is rarely discernible throughout the manuscript. Français 23112 features catchwords as well as quire signatures (in the form of Roman numerals in black ink) at the bottom center margin of the last verso of each quire. On some rectos, such as f.3r for example, running titles in faded black ink and medieval foliation numbers in the form of Roman numerals are sometimes still visible in the top margin, but on most folios these have been cut off. However, the texts are still clearly numbered in a medieval hand using Roman numerals centered in the top margin above the text block in alternating red and blue ink. Otherwise, the foliation of this manuscript is modern with Arabic numerals written in pen in the top right corner of each recto.\nThe manuscript’s decorative elements are limited but noteworthy. It does not contain any illustrations, nor is there any space left blank for anticipated miniatures, but highly detailed pen-flourished initials are executed in alternating red and blue ink throughout the manuscript. Occasionally visible under these intricate initials are the scribe’s note to the rubricator as to what letter should be added. Most of these initials are only two lines high, but much larger initials — as tall as 10 lines in height — indicate the beginning of each text. The parted initial “O” of this copy of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne is six lines high, and its width causes the first six verses of the text to bulge out into the center margin of the page.\nThe manuscript is bound in red moroccan leather with the arms of Richelieu in gold on the front and back cover. These arms bear the phrase, “HIS FULTA MANEBUNT” (or roughly “They will remain supported by them”). The spine offers the title “VIE DES / SAINCTS” in gold lettering. The current binding, is of course, not original to the manuscript, and a modern table of contents is found on the verso of the frontmost parchment folio (a parchment folio that is not included in the foliation count), facing f.1r. The binding is quite tight, making it difficult to read the text closest to the gutter throughout the codex. This tightness would likely make it difficult to execute a full color digitization from the codex. During the restoration of the manuscript, some patches were added to repair holes, such as on the outer edge of f.174 near the bottom corner. On f.200r, there is a nearly invisible slice, which seems to have been the result of an accident, through the parchment that runs about 40mm long near the bottom of the outer text column. The parchment throughout the codex is arranged with hair-side facing hair and flesh-side facing flesh.",

    "text": "T-B\n\nOxford, Bodleian, Canonici Miscellaneous 74. ff.109r-120r. Early 13th century, provenance pre-18th century unknown.\nCanonici Miscellaneous 74 is a small but significant codex safely datable to at least the early thirteenth century,17 possibly dating to the late twelfth century, making it the oldest extant copy of Version T.18 Offering 1,327 verses of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne, T-B serves as the base text of Cruz-Sáenz’s edition and has informed the works of Emma Campbell, Amy Ogden, and Erik Rankka.19 In addition to the Life of Mary the Egyptian, this manuscript also contains the Lives of Saints Alexis (ff.1r-19r), Julienne (ff.62r-84v), Euphrosine (ff.87r-108v), and André l’Apôtre (ff.120r-131r) — with Mary the Egyptian coming between these last two saints — as well as the Poème moral (ff.19r-62r) in quatrains and Li ver del juïse (ff.131r-138r).\nThe manuscript is composed of 138 parchment folios,20 with two front paper pages and one paper endpage, undoubtedly inserted at the time of its modern rebinding.21 The binding is reddish-brown leather with yellow-gold detailing and a deep green rectangle on its spine that reads “VITE / DI SANTI / IN LINGUA / PROVENZ / COD. MEM.” The codex measures 180x110mm, with a writing space of 133x85mm. The text block is written in a single column, with twenty-nine lines per page and an average line height of 5mm. For the Life of Saint Mary the Egyptian, each line has both initial and final letter separation (except when the poetic lines are too long to allow space before the final letter), and each contains two poetic lines separated by a midline punctus. The pricking has not been trimmed away, and the ruling, though faint, is visible throughout. The foliation is modern, written in pencil in the top right corner of each recto. There are, also, a few visible quire signatures in this manuscript, but for the most part, quire signatures are not observable.\nCanonici Misc. 74 is a minimally decorated manuscript. It does not contain any illustrations, but it features some large initials — typically two or four lines high — executed in red, and occasionally light blue, ink. The red initial “O” of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne is about four lines high and is lightly accented with faded pen floriations. There is no rubric within the ruled text block for our text, but the title “de marie egipcienne” is written across the top margin on f.109r. where the text begins. There are some examples of red ink rubrics used elsewhere in the manuscript, such as the rubric for the Life of Andrew the Apostle on f.120r.\nThe origin of Canonici Misc. 74 prior to the eighteenth century is unknown, but it was acquired by the Italian Jesuit and bibliophile Matteo Luigi Canonici (1727-1805) who passed it along with most of his vast collection (of about 3,500 manuscripts) to his brother Giuseppe (d.1807) who, then, passed the collection on to his nephew Giobanni Perissinotti. The collection was ultimately purchased by the Bodleian in 1817.22\nThe identities of the scribes of Canonici Misc. 74 are likewise unknown, but we can say that the language of this manuscript contains Picard features such as the typical use of “le” for the feminine singular article. An obvious shift in hands occurs on f.120r from the end of the Life of Mary the Egyptian to the beginning of the Life of Saint Andrew the Apostle, but Cruz-Sáenz agrees with Baker’s assertion that there are, in fact, three distinct hands in this manuscript writing, “the first copyist wrote the Alexis, the Poème moral, and the Juliane; the second wrote the Euphrosine and Marie l’Égyptienne; and the third wrote the Andrier and Juïse” (23).23",

    "text": "T-C\n\nOxford, Corpus Christi College, 232. ff.35r-64v. Early 14th century, from Canterbury.\nAnother rather small codex like Canonici Misc. 74, Corpus Christi College 232 is only slightly larger, measuring 190x125mm overall with a writing space of 147x70mm. Despite its size, CCC 232 offers 1,532 verses of Version T, making it the longest extant manuscript of this text.24 CCC 232 is, also, likely the latest medieval copy of Version T with an approximate dating to the early fourteenth century.25\nBarker-Benfield’s edition of the fifteenth-century St. Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury catalog26 provides a thorough description of CCC 232, noting also that CCC 260 f.84b was formerly CCC 232’s front flyleaf.27 It is at the bottom of this stray flyleaf that the pressmark of St. Augustine’s Abbey may be found, providing greater clarity for CCC 232’s provenance, though it is unclear if this particular manuscript was a product of the abbey’s own scriptorium or an outside acquisition.28 CCC 232’s movement out of Canterbury was likely triggered by the dissolution of the abbey by Henry VIII, but as Barker-Benfield describes, “Even after 1538, the library itself seems to have maintained a shadowy half-life for another few decades, with books apparently abandoned on site (whether or not in the old Library Room) and gradually dispersed by the later secular inhabitants” (vol. 1, lii). Sometime after leaving Canterbury, the manuscript became a part of the collection of John Dee (1527-1608/9), court astronomer and advisor to Elizabeth I (1533-1603) and antiquarian.29 Dee’s diary reveals that his home and collection was, sadly, “plundered by the populace” (Halliwell-Phillipps vii) while he was away traveling. Eventually, CCC 232 was in the possession of Brian Twyne (d.1644), who was himself educated at the college in Oxford. He appears to have left the manuscript — along with many others — to Corpus Christi College upon his death. Matthew Cooke’s 1852 edition of T-C was quite useful to subsequent researchers in the identification of other copies of Version T. For instance, it is thanks to Cooke’s work that Tobler was later able to identify T-fragment F2 among the many Damascus fragments sent to Berlin at the turn of the twentieth-century to be photographed and studied.30\nIn terms of its structure, CCC 232 is composed of 92 parchment folios with two additional paper pages added to both the front and the end of the codex at the time of its modern rebinding. The manuscript’s parchment is arranged with hair-side facing hair and flesh-side facing flesh. Pricking is still visible on many folios, and the penciled ruling remains clear throughout the codex. The text block is formatted with either one or two columns per page and as many as 44 lines per column, depending on the text. On the folios containing La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne, however, the layout is single-column with 26 lines each. The average height of each line is 5mm. The single-column sections have a column width of 72mm, while the two-column sections have a width of 50mm per column. The foliation is modern, marked in Arabic numerals in the top right corner of every recto. CCC 232 lacks catchwords and quire signatures, and its rubrication is inconsistent; while the Life of Mary the Egyptian is rubricated in red ink,31 other texts in this codex have different styles. The text of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne also includes pilcrows in red ink to indicate sections of the narrative. The manuscript does not contain any illustrations, but it features some bold initials in red and black ink.\nIn this copy of T, there is initial letter separation with each initial letter accentuated with red ink. The line breaks respect the ends of verses, and punctus marks at the end of every second line indicate the end of each couplet. The scribe of T-C maintained a neat bookhand and left generous space in the ruled column, contributing to this copy’s readability. The scribe is unknown, but Dembowski agrees with Baker’s assertion that the scribe had an apparently clumsy knowledge of French (Dembowski 26). In terms of glosses, there appear to be the tips of manicules in the upper right margins of both f.41r and f.42r mostly lost due to trimming, but otherwise, there are no glosses in this copy.\nThe manuscript’s binding is modern with a brown leather cover and yellow-gold lettering. The spine reads “GROSTETE / ETC” in reference to the other contents of this manuscript, which include Robert Grosseteste’s Chastel d’Amour (ff.1r-35r), a Latin mass for William Longsword, earl of Salisbury (d. 1250) in leonine verse (ff.64v-66v), The Miracle of Sardenai in French verse (ff.67r-71r), three Latin poems by Walter of Wimborne (ff.73v-82r), and various other Latin poems. La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne appears second in this manuscript; it follows the Chastel d’Amour and precedes the Latin mass. There is a modern table of contents in the front pages.",

    "text": "T-D\n\nParis, BnF, Français 19525. ff.15r-26v. Second half of 13th century, from Oxford.\nLike Français 23112, manuscript Français 19525 may be found at the Richelieu site of the BnF. Dated to the second half of the thirteenth century, this copy of Version T offers 1,442 verses of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne as well as many other Lives of saints in verse and in prose including Saints Laurent (ff.1r-8r), Jean le Baptiste (ff.36r-38v), and Marguerite (ff.141v-145r). This codex also includes other religious texts like Li ver del juïse (ff.43v-46v) and Le Besant de Dieu (ff.96r-125r), which have received editorial attention from Erik Rankka and Pierre Ruelle respectively.32 The Life of Mary the Egyptian is preceded in this manuscript by La Vision de saint Paul (ff.12v-15r) and is followed by La vie de sainte Alexis (ff. 26v-30v). In his edition, Dembowski suggests that the scribe of T-D had a poor understanding of metrics,33 but the scribe has copied the text in a clean book hand using initial letter separation and few abbreviations, making this copy rather easy to read.\nThe provenance of Français 19525 has been extensively documented on the BnF online record. The digital catalog suggests that the manuscript was copied by many hands34 and links the codex to the atelier of William de Brailes, an English illuminator active in Oxford between 1230 and 1260. The manuscript was later purchased by Louis de Bruges (1427-1492), seigneur de Gruuthuse, whose arms are painted in the center of the lower margin of f.1r. Also visible in the upper margin of f.1r is the inscription of the poet Philippe Desportes (1546-1606). In the seventeenth century, the codex entered the library of chancellor Pierre Séguier (1588-1672) and later passed to his grandson, Henri-Charles de Cambout de Coislin (1665-1732), the Bishop of Metz. Français 19525 — along with the rest of the Coislin collection — was left to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés on 1 May 1731 and entered the abbey’s collection in 1735. This acquisition is documented in the manuscript on f.1r on the right side of the bottom margin with the inscription “S.G. 1856” — the former shelf mark of the manuscript. In the midst of the French Revolution, the BnF acquired Français 19525 along with the thousands of other manuscripts of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in 1796.35\nMeasuring 225x155mm, Français 19525 is composed of 204 parchment folios, along with four paper front pages and four paper back pages, added sometime during its modern rebinding. The writing space measures 145x120mm, with up to three columns per page — though Version T is consistently copied on two-column pages — and typically thirty-two lines per column. The average height of each line is 5mm. Although pricking is rarely visible due to trimming, some evidence of pricking remains, notably on the lower outer edge of f.151, where there is also a marginal note to the rubricator indicating the need for a floriated initial “e” in the text block. The parchment leaves feel rather thin and are arranged with hair-side facing hair and flesh-side facing flesh. Penciled ruling is present throughout most of the manuscript, except on ff.123-132, and the text is written above the top ruled line on each page, which supports the dating of this manuscript to the thirteenth century. The foliation is modern, with Arabic numerals in ink at the top right corner of each recto. While catchwords are absent from this manuscript — perhaps also lost due to trimming —, quire signatures in the form of Roman numerals can be seen in the center of the bottom margins of the first half of the codex. The manuscript’s rubrication is incomplete; space has been left for rubrics at the start of each text, but the rubrics themselves were never added. However, in the margins at the beginning of each text, there are faded ink notes — likely contemporary to the scribe — meant for the rubricator, indicating the subject matter of each text. For example in the bottom margin of f.15r, we can clearly read “Gypciene,” indicating the need for a rubric for the Life of Mary the Egyptian. A modern hand has also added Arabic numerals to number the texts in this codex (The Life of Mary the Egyptian is the fourth text in this manuscript.), and occasionally, modern titles are provided in thin pen ink. There is a modern table of contents on the facing page of f.1r.\nThere are other notable physical oddities of this manuscript. For instance, there is a small triangular hole in the bottom outer corner of f.50, with a little green tassel (about 5mm long) still attached to the slight tab of parchment formed by this hole. The tassel seems to be a bookmark of some kind, appearing at the beginning of the Gospel of Nicodemus. The scribes of Français 19525 were careful to copy around the occasional preexisting holes in the parchment, such as those found on f.105. This folio (f.105) has also suffered extensive damage, apparently from scraping, with the text on the verso especially affected.36 Given that the damage is isolated to f.105, it is possible that it was inflicted intentionally, perhaps to remove an unwanted portion of text. On f.105, there is also an approximately 60mm vertical cut running from the top margin down the outer edge of the writing space on the recto. This cut disrupts the alignment of the text at the top of the first column on the verso of f.105 as the scribe chose to squeeze the first nine lines to the right of the cut. Folio 204 — the last medieval folio of this manuscript — is a fragment with the bottom two thirds of the folio having been torn away. In the remaining recto of f.204, musical notation has been added by a late medieval hand along with the charming doodle of a bird-like creature with a bearded human’s face looking up to the musical tune.\nIn terms of binding and decoration, the cover is made of a brown marbled calf leather with a red leather spine featuring the monogram of Louis XVIII in gold, and the spine reads “VIE / DE / LAURENT &C.” Apart from several historiated initials (f.67r, f.141v, f.145r, and f.153r), decoration in Français 19525 is modest, lacking any other illustrations. However, there are many beautifully floriated initials throughout the codex executed in alternating red and blue ink.",

    "text": "T-E\n\nParis, BnF Arsenal, 3516. ff.113v-117v. 1267/1268, from Artois.\nThis manuscript is the only copy of Version T located at the Arsenal site of the BnF — though a copy of Version U (MS 3706, fifteenth century) may also be found in the Arsenal collection. Arsenal 3516 is composed of 357 parchment folios, with the addition of a paper front page and a paper endpage inserted at the time of the codex’s modern rebinding.37 Its dimensions are 330x255mm — making it the largest copy of Version T —, with a writing space of 242x205mm. The binding of Arsenal 3516 is not featured in the digitized version available online, but the BnF record notes that it is a “Reliure en veau fauve.” The folios of the manuscript are all formatted with either three or four columns with fifty lines per column. The average height of each line is 5mm. Pricking is visible on the outer edges of the folios as well as along the bottom edge, which was used to set the width of the columns. The penciled ruling is also still plainly visible throughout the manuscript. The manuscript features both medieval and modern foliation with medieval Roman numerals appear in the the top margin of the verso in ink, while modern Arabic numerals are written in pencil in the top right corner of each recto. However, these numbers do not always agree due to the removal of thirteen leaves from throughout the codex.38 Additionally, folios 23, 222, and 336 are all significantly smaller pieces of parchment — each about half the dimensions of the rest of the folios in this codex — that have been tipped in.39 Catchwords can be found in the bottom right corner of the last verso of some quires (e.g. f.91v), along with both medieval and modern quire signatures. The medieval quire signatures are Roman numerals in ink appearing in the center of the bottom margin on both the last verso and first recto of each quire (e.g. ff.115v-116r), while a modern hand has penciled in a quire count on the first recto of each quire. The modern quire count was apparently added at some point after the digitization of Arsenal 3516 was produced as these numbers do not appear online but were present during my visit to the Arsenal in January 2024.\nGuggenbühl hypothesizes that Arsenal 3516 may have originally belonged to a wealthy bourgeois of Saint-Omer or perhaps to one of two brothers of King Louis IX: Charles I of Anjou, who might have received it as a wedding gift on the occasion of his marriage to Marguerite of Tonnerre, or Robert II of Artois, who could have acquired it at the time of his knighting.40 There is some slight debate as to the precise year this manuscript was produced, but it certainly originates from Artois and dates to the late 1260s.41\nWhile the language of the anonymous author of Version T is Anglo-Norman, the language of this manuscript is heavily colored by an apparently Picard copyist.42 For example, we have the typical Picard use of “le” for the feminine singular article, but we also see features like the use of the vowels “eu/e” in place of “o/e” in preterites.43\nArsenal 3516 contains both religious and secular texts in verse and prose, including many saints’ Lives, Biblical excerpts, scientific explanations of nature and a bestiary. A medieval table of contents, which has some minor, clarifying glosses written in pen, appears on f.3v. Throughout the manuscript, each text is introduced and concluded with rubrications in red and blue ink, and each begins with an elaborate floriated initial of the same colors. La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne is positioned between the Lives of Saints Thaïs (ff. 109v-113v) and Juliane (ff.117v-121r).44\nThe manuscript was originally lavishly decorated with at least one miniature per text, but most of these have been cut out. While T-E is the only T manuscript that would have included a miniature of Mary the Egyptian, this miniature has also been lost. However, two frontispieces in this manuscript remain: one on f.154v depicting the Second Coming and another on f.217v depicting five mounted knights and a castle ablaze. The miniatures on folios 198v-212v associated with the bestiary are still intact as are the circular diagrams of various sizes on ff.157r-173v, 179r/v, and 180v. Glosses found throughout the manuscript, including corrections, marginal notes, and pen trials, suggest that it was usefully read by its various owners over time.\nIn terms of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne, this manuscript offers 1,489 extant verses, though approximately sixty verses near the end of the narrative are missing due to the mutilation of f.117. This copy is mostly presented in a four-column format, though f.113v where the Life of Mary the Egyptian begins has a three-column format. The line breaks respect the verses almost entirely, but in the first column of f.117v two verses have been split over four lines. Due to the mutilation of this folio, it is not possible to say definitively why the scribe chose to divide these verses in this way, but it was likely a decision made to ensure the text would conclude on the appropriate line in the third column without leaving any empty space that might disrupt the aesthetics of the page layout. Overall, the word spacing in T-E is rather inconsistent, and the text is quite abbreviated, making it a more challenging copy to read with fluidity.",

    "text": "T-L\n\nLondon, British Library, Additional 36614. ff.271v-282v. Second half of 13th century, provenance pre-19th century unknown.\nAdd. 36614 is in many ways a unique manuscript among the Version T corpus. Unlike the other codices containing Version T of the Life of Mary the Egyptian, which feature collections of various texts, the contents of Add. 36614 are limited to a suite of texts centered around Chrétien de Troyes’s Perceval, ou le Conte du Graal (ff.7v-84r) — including the Bliocadran (ff.1v-7v) and two continuations: the anonymous Continuation Gauvain (ff.84r-163r) and the Continuation du Conte du Graal by Wauchier de Denain (ff.163r-268r) — and La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne (ff.271v-282v). In place of the typical first four verses (and their minor variants) found in all other T copies, T-L begins with these fourteen unique verses:\n\n\nTot li home & totes les femes.\nQ[ui] vuelent pendre penita[n]ce.\ndoivent bie[n] escouter la vie.\nde l[’]egipciene marie\npar tot le mo[n]t ta[n]t co[m] est ample.\nI poieent p[r]endre g[ra]nt essample.\nEle fu molt bele & m[o]lt ge[n]te.\n& pecha molt en sa jovente.\nMais puis qu[’]ele se porpensa.\nA damledeu se retorna.\n& ensable o lui s[’]ajosta.\nSi q[ue] ja mais n[’]en severra.\n& tot cil q[ui] sa vie orront\nGra[n]t essample pre[n]dre i porro[n]t.\n\n\n\nBecause circumstances have prevented me from consulting this manuscript in more detail, my own observations of T-L are limited compared to the data I have collected from the other T manuscripts. I cannot independently confirm the exact number of verses of T contained in Add. 36614, but in his edition, Dembowski reports that this copy is missing 240 verses due to missing folios (26),45 and the 1907 catalog of the British Museum says that this manuscript contains “about 1,350 lines” (156). This copy of Version T begins without title or rubric, but the initial “T” is drawn in red and is about three lines tall. The word spacing is not entirely consistent in this copy; occasionally, we see the use of initial letter separation, but this practice is not consistent. T-L appears to have been copied entirely by the same scribe, who makes regular use of abbreviations. Roach suggests that this copy of Mary the Egyptian was the addition of a fourteenth-century hand, but Dembowski does not confirm this suggestion.46 In terms of dialect in Add. 36614, Micha notes, “Dialecte francien avec influence picarde pour Perceval le Vieil” (62), but Version T in this manuscript does not demonstrate the same Picard influence.\nThe manuscript’s provenance is not known, but the codex is dated to the second half of the thirteenth century.47 The modern history of this manuscript, which is wrapped up in the actions of the controversial bookdealers Joseph Barrois (1785-1855)48 and Guglielmo Libri (1802-1869), is documented in Williman and Corsano’s chapter “In the British Royal Library.” In brief, the fourth Earl of Ashburnham (1797-1878) purchased a collection of more than 700 manuscripts, including Add. 36614 (formerly MS Barrois 1), from Barrois in 1849. Following the Earl’s death, the Barrois Manuscripts of the Ashburnham Library were sold at auction, with Add. 36614 listed as Lot #463. At the time of this auction, the manuscript’s binding is described as “Modern boarded blue morocco, with rich gilt ornaments, joints, g. E. WITH A VERY ANCIENT CARVING IN IVORY (7 ¼ by 3 ½ in.), REPRESENTING THE DEATH OF THE EMPEROR SEPTIMUS SEVERUS, INSERTED IN THE COVER” (Ashburnham Library 171). By the time of the British Museum’s 1907 catalog, this ivory panel has been separated from the rest of the codex and is reidentified as “representing the death of Jacob,” (157). The ivory panel has since been dated to the tenth/eleventh century, and while MS Add. 36614 is housed in the British Library, the ivory panel is kept in the British Museum. The panel is not currently on display there, but it has been photographed and may be consulted online.49\nIn terms of structure, Add. 36614 is made up of 282 parchment folios, arranged hair-hair-flesh-flesh, with some front and end pages likely inserted when the manuscript was last rebound. The manuscript folios are formatted with two columns per page, and each column has thirty lines with an average height of 7mm each. The width of each column is 74mm. The manuscript has modern foliation written in pencil in the top right corners of the rectos. Some folios have medieval Roman numerals as well, but these appear on a minority of pages. The dimensions of the manuscript are 310x220mm, with a ruled writing space of 240x150mm. The ruling of Add. 36614 was apparently done in pencil and is present throughout the manuscript, but on the folios containing the Life of Mary the Egyptian, this ruling has been almost entirely erased. Add. 36614 lacks quire signatures and rubrics, and there is no medieval table of contents. The manuscript also has no miniatures or frontispieces, but in the empty space of f.268r at the end of the Conte du Graal there are the “armes au lion de Flandre, et au-dessus, la devise : ‘Flandres : au : lion’” (Micha 62). Added glosses throughout the codex suggest this manuscript was actively read.",

    "text": "T-F1\n\nManchester, John Rylands Library, French 6. f.8r-8v. Second half of 13th century, provenance pre-19th century unknown.\nFrench 6 is a collection of twelve parchment folios, “réunis sous une couverture moderne de vélin blanc et portant au dos le titre ‘VIE DES SAINZ. CIRC. 1320’” (Fawtier & Fawtier-Jones 321), containing ten incomplete texts that were bound together sometime in the nineteenth century. According to Ker’s description, French 6 was “bound for Lord Crawford in stiff parchment in the same style as Rylands Lat. 26” (453).50 The overall dimensions of this manuscript are 272x190mm, with a writing space of approximately 190x129mm, though slight variations in this writing space occur across the manuscript. Fawtier and Fawtier-Jones suggest the folios of this manuscript originate from two or three source manuscripts with folios 1-8 dating to the first half of the fourteenth century (321), though because the first line of writing in these folios is above the top ruled line, I would suggest pushing this dating somewhat earlier. Folios 9-12, which Fawtier and Fawtier-Jones date to the second half of the thirteenth century, have been cropped at the bottom, resulting in a significant loss of the bottom margin, though the writing space remains intact. The manuscript has modern foliation, added in pencil just below the bottom right corner of the text block of each recto in the form of Arabic numerals. Otherwise, French 6 does not contain any glosses on the parchment folios. Only the initial letter “A” of French 6 is painted and illuminated with gold. All other major initials in this manuscript are drawn in red or blue ink with some minor fine-lined flourishes in red or blue ink. Apart from the initial “A” in French 6 which features the figure of a haloed saint and a bird, there are no other illustrations in this manuscript. There is an inconsistent presence of pricking in this manuscript, unsurprisingly as the fragments were all most likely trimmed down for its current binding. Each folio is formatted with two columns per page and either forty-one or forty-two lines per column. The average height of each of these lines is 4mm, and the width of each column is 68mm. As French 6 is a fragmentary manuscript, there is, of course, no medieval table of contents, but there is also no modern table of contents. The ten fragmentary texts of French 6 are all religious in nature and include: Maurice de Sully’s Explication du Pater (ff.3r-3v); Adam de Ross’s Vision de saint Paul (ff.3v-5r), La vie de saint Jean-Baptiste (in prose) (ff.5r & 2v); Passion de Saint Paul (in prose) (ff.2v & 1r-1v); Li ver del juïse (ff.1v & 8r); La vie de sainte Catherine d’Alexandrie (ff.9r-10r); La vie de sainte Alexis (ff.10r-10v); Poème sur l’Antéchrist de Henri d’Arci (ff.11r-12r); Les Quinze Signes (f.12r); and of course, La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne, which sits between Li ver del juïse and the Life of Saint Catherine.51\nIn his edition, Dembowski notes that this fragment of Mary the Egyptian was not publicly known until Fawtier & Fawtier-Jones published on it in 1923 in Romania, and so Baker was unaware of its existence at the time of his own study (27). By my count, T-F1 offers the first 163.5 verses of T.52 The text is introduced with red ink rubrication. Interestingly, the aesthetic formatting of this rubric matches the preceding text with its initial letter separation and verse-aligned line breaks, and the rubric has been composed to match the octosyllabic rhyming couplets of Version T. It reads:\n\nD e seinte marie legyptien\nD irrum ore lestorie bien.\n\n\nBut T-F1 itself has been copied in the style of prose: the text fills the ruled space without regard for either the verse or word separation. The scribe does, however, indicate the end of each verse with a punctus and the start the each verse with red ink, and each word that is separated by a line break is marked with a slash at the end of the line. It is unclear why the scribe would abandon the formatting of the preceding text (initial letter separation and verse-aligned line breaks), for this copy of Version T. Perhaps the scribe was navigating a shortage of space or perhaps our text was of less importance to whoever commissioned the original volume? In any case, the scribe makes the metrical structure and rhyme scheme of T-F1 clear to the reader by establishing both in the rubric.\nThe provenance of French 6 is a subject of considerable interest. The fragment was likely purchased by Lord Crawford in the Libri sale of 1859 and became part of the Rylands collection in 1901.53 French 6’s origins prior to the 19th century are not entirely known, but Russell’s 1989 bulletin meaningfully fills in some of these gaps and builds significantly on the initial 1923 Romania notice. Fawtier and Fawtier-Jones make clear the fact that the first eight folios of French 6 are a quire that has been rebound out of order (321). These folios should appear in the following order: 3-4-5-2-1-6-7-8, and Russell supplies a clear motivation for this incorrect arrangement:\n\nThe reason for the displacement of the original central bifolium by those responsible for the present order is obvious when one considers the fragment. … the perpetrators of this change have found a way to place the beginning of a text at the beginning of the manuscript fragment, to give the impression that the fragment is a complete entity in itself. Furthermore, this text, the ‘Passion de saint Paul,’ is the only one in [MS French 6] which has an initial letter decorated in golf leaf, and is by far the most attractive introductory capital letter of any found in this fragment. (42)\n\nBut from what manuscript was this quire excised? Russell suggests that at least folios 1-8 of French 6 were originally part of British Library Egerton 2710 — a legendary dating to the second half of the thirteenth century —, a claim which he supports convincingly with both physical and textual evidence. First, there are no catchwords in French 6, but there is one medieval quire signature “XX” at the very bottom of the center margin of f.8v. Russell makes use of this quire signature to support his argument that French 6 is a continuation of Egerton 2710, which is incomplete following its own quire signature “XIX.” More compellingly, when rearranged in the proper order, f.3 of French 6 is a perfect continuation of the incomplete Explication du Pater of Maurice de Sully found in Egerton 2710 (43). Furthermore, Russell highlights the fact that the contents of Egerton 2710 are “very close” (44) to that of BnF Français 19525, the manuscript containing copy D of Version T of the Life of Mary the Egyptian, and in his edition, Dembowski himself suggests T-F1 “semble suivre de très près le même texte que le ms. D” (27). The text of copies T-D and T-F1 are quite similar,54 but the dimensions, formatting, decorative elements, and material evidence of BnF Français 19525 and Egerton 2710 merit closer attention before drawing any more definitive conclusions about the possible relationship between these codices.55 Both BnF Français 19525 and John Rylands French 6 may be consulted online and in the reading room, but at time of writing, access to Egerton 2710 at the British Library is still limited. The likeness between BnF Français 19525 and the first folios of John Rylands French 6, originating from Egerton 2710, merits further attention elsewhere.56\nThe folios that would follow f.8 of French 6 are still undiscovered, leaving the door open to the exciting possibility that the missing folios of T-F1 could be recovered elsewhere among the unidentified jumbled fragments of some other manuscript collection. Such a discovery would allow for a more elaborate analysis of the possible relationship between copies T-D and T-F1, and such a discovery would undoubtedly bring the discoverer the same satisfaction Russell himself describes, “…the satisfaction one gains from discovering the source of a manuscript fragment which has remained separated from its original manuscript for several centuries, stems no doubt from the feeling that one has, in a very small way, reversed the process of time” (46).",

    "text": "T-F2\n\nThe location of the original fragment — dated to the second half of the 12th century and most likely originating in Europe — is unknown, but a photographic copy may be found here:\n\nBerlin, Staatsbibliothek, Photographien von ausgewählten Fragmenten aus der Omayyaden-Moschee in Damaskus in verschiedenen Sprachen, 1908. Mss simulata orientalia 6, Orientalische Handschriften digital, Photographs 89 (verso) & 101 (recto), http://resolver.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/SBB000074F100000000.\n\nGiannini and Minervini provide devastating clarity as to the current status of T-F2, “Up to the beginning of the twentieth century, four Old French pieces were stored in the Qubbat al-khazna adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. All of them are now nowhere to be found” (331).57 Of the Old French fragments documented in Damascus, Adolf Tobler says that T-F2 is of less importance than the bifolium of Fierabras,58 but T-F2 is of great importance to the study of Version T of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne as it represents the only physical, textual evidence that the T poem traveled as far as the Middle East. While the original parchment fragment of T-F2 is currently considered lost — perhaps surviving undocumented in either Damascus or possibly Istanbul —59 its contents are preserved through the photographs taken by German philologists at the turn of the twentieth century. These photographs are housed in the Staatsbibliothek of Berlin and have been digitized, allowing for continued study.\nT-F2 is a single parchment folio offering thirty-eight verses of Version T, with twenty verses on the recto and eighteen verses on the verso. Dembowski notes that these verses correspond to vv. 967-1004 of his edition (27), and in his own published description, Adolf Tobler compares this fragment to vv. 979-1016 of copy T-C (Oxford Corpus Christi College 232),60 which he includes side-by-side with his own transcription of the Damascus fragment.\nAccording to Tobler, who examined the parchment fragment when it was on loan in Germany, T-F2 is remarkably small, measuring just 70x50mm, with the text arranged in a single column within a writing space of 52x32mm.61 Tobler notes these unusually small proportions are likely due to the damaging effects of moisture on the parchment over time, which have caused the leaf to shrink considerably.62 The fragment’s tight spacing makes it exceptionally difficult to transcribe, and due to a rip in the parchment at the bottom left corner of the recto, the initial letters of the three verses at the bottom of that page have been lost entirely.63\nIn their recent publication concerning T-F2 and the other fragments of Old French recovered from the Damascus geniza, Giannini and Minervini make use of the available paleographic and linguistic evidence to conjecture — based both on the fragment’s size and the roughness of the scribal hand therein64 — that T-F2 may represent a rare, surviving example of the sort of loosely bound booklet through which texts commonly traveled in the medieval period (351).65 Furthermore, Giannini and Minervini offer a dating of T-F2 to the second half of the twelfth century, suggesting that the writing is reminiscent of the rough draft style used in England in that period.66 Based on this dating, T-F2 is not just the most well-traveled but also significantly the earliest witness to the T poem. If more unknown pieces of T-F2 could somehow be recovered from the dispersed corpus of the Damascus fragments, invaluable insights into the earliest iterations of Version T could be revealed.\nAlthough Giannini and Minervini cannot say with any certainty how or when T-F2 first entered the treasure of the Great Mosque of Damascus (342), their thoughtful speculation on this fragment’s journey east invites curiosity as to why someone might choose this specific text to carry with them:\n\n…the story of the Egyptian prostitute who chose, after visiting the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, to become a penitent hermit in the Transjordanian desert, had an immediate appeal among Western pilgrims on their way to the holy places. The saint, moreover, was venerated in the Orthodox and Coptic churches, thus representing an element of cultural convergence between the Franks and the local Christians. (346)\n\nThe fragmentary yet invaluable witness of T-F2 underscores the significance of examining each manuscript that preserves La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne. Through careful attention to the textual, paleographic, and material details of these manuscripts, we gain a deeper understanding not only of the text’s transmission but also of its reach and resonance across disparate cultural and geographic contexts. Together, the histories of these eight manuscript witnesses illuminate the diverse audiences — monastics (T-C), nobles (T-E), collectors (T-F1), scholars (T-B), travelers (T-F2) — whose own interests have intersected the enduring work of the T-poet.",

It was impossible under the circumstances to retrieve the original manuscripts, but I was offered the possibility of consulting the microfilms, which could be found using their card catalog. Out of the six manuscripts I hoped to see, only one (MS Old Royal 20 D VI, which contains a copy of Version Z of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne) was available in this format. I was told not to go out and buy a lottery ticket any time soon by a sympathetic staff member.↩︎\n These works include digitized and microfilm reproductions, detailed catalog records both online and in print, and other useful studies.↩︎\n Dembowski’s edition of less than three hundred pages covers a great deal of ground. His introduction situates the French tradition of the Vie within the broader context of the legend. His edition provides edited transcripts of thirteen versions (T, X, V, W, N, O, O1, Z, U, Y, L1, L2, and L3), each based on a single manuscript copy, and includes notes on textual variants across the manuscript copies. Notably, Dembowski’s corpus includes all French versions of the Vie except for Rutebeuf’s Version R, which he acknowledges but does not himself edit. He also offers brief descriptions of all forty-two of the known manuscript copies containing these many versions (excluding those containing R), while noting the existence of one additional copy of Version O — Basel, University Library, Comites Latentes 102 (formerly Phillipps 3660) — which he reports was accessible only for a cursory examination at the time (“n’est accessible que pour un examen superficiel,” 173), and so, he excludes it from his table of manuscripts and variance notes and provides no description of it.↩︎\nThe initials used to identify each of these manuscript copies were assigned by Alfred Baker in the fourth chapter (“Les manuscrits de la vie rimée” pp. 182-187) of his edition. At the time however, Baker was unaware of the Manchester fragment as it would not be uncovered until 1923, and so, he labeled the Damascus fragment simply F. Dembowski adopted Baker’s use of these identifying initials, adding superscript numbers to distinguish between the two fragments.↩︎\nFor example, the dimensions of the only extant manuscript copy of Marie l’Égyptienne - Version Y (Lille, Bibliothèque municipal, 795) are 390x280mm, but the physical reality of these numbers is much harder to conceptualize and remember than imagining the average sized oval dutch oven, which can be of very similar dimensions. With 589 folios, MS 795 is also quite a stout volume — measuring 145mm in depth, or about the length of an iPhone — and is too heavy for one person to lift and move comfortably. Thinking about all this size data more concretely helps us to more immediately understand that this was obviously not a particularly portable volume.↩︎\nThere are sixteen extant medieval manuscript images associated with full French texts of La vie de sainte Marie l’Égyptienne. Among these, seven depict the encounter between Zozimas and Mary the Egyptian in which the holy man offers the nude Mary his cloak. For example in the miniature of a late thirteenth-century copy of Version U (Lyon, Bibliothèque municipale, 867, f.71v), Zozimas is shown shyly looking away as he gives his cloak to Mary who stares back at him. Her nude body is entirely enveloped by her long hair, and their hands meet in the center of the miniature.↩︎\nThere is an ongoing effort at the British Library to digitize more and more of their manuscript collections, but according to their most recent list of fully digitized manuscripts released in 2022, T-L has not yet been digitized. This list is available via Calum Cockburn’s blog post for the Medieval manuscripts blog of the British Library on 18 January 2022.↩︎\n Unfortunately, I became aware of this microform copy too late to make use of it directly to inform this dissertation. The microforms held at the Van Pelt may be consulted on site in the library’s Microtext Department in Philadelphia, but the reproduction and interlibrary loan of any Van Pelt microforms would require the permission of the repository holding the original manuscript — in this case the BL. A complete list of the Van Pelt microforms may be found here: https://guides.library.upenn.edu/MedievalMSSmicrotext↩︎\nIn the reading room at the Bodleian, readers are permitted to take their own images for research purposes, and so I have been able to inform this dissertation with images of T-B that I took in the fall of 2022. However at the British Library, readers are not permitted to take pictures of certain manuscripts, including manuscript T-L.↩︎\nThese paper pages have visible chainlines and watermarks. The innermost front paper page features a watermark resembling a cluster of grapes, and the outermost back paper page has a watermark of a fleur-de-lis with the initials “CB” on a banner underneath.↩︎\n“Ce manuscrit est un de ceux qui furent donnés à la maison de Sorbonne par le cardinal de Richelieu” (112).↩︎\nThis prayer begins in the line immediately following the Life of Mary the Egyptian on f.344r with a parted blue and red initial “B” that is two lines high.↩︎\nhttps://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc52450n↩︎\nIn his edition, Dembowski says the language is “fortement picardisée” (25), but he does not elaborate with many linguistic details.↩︎\nOn his choice of base copy, Dembowski writes, “Ce choix est grandement simplifié du fait que, comme nous l’avons déjà vu, les mss. B et D donnent des versions très abrégés du récit et que les mss. E et L ont des lacunes considérables. Il ne nous reste donc que A et C. Vu que C est plus récent que A, vu que C a un nombre de leçons inférieures à A, vu que le scribe de A donne un texte très soigné, vu enfin que le texte de C est connu grâce à l’édition de Baker (sans mentionner celle de Cooke), le choix de A s’impose” (30).↩︎\nCampbell notes that the hands are all recognizable as thirteenth-century (236).↩︎\nCruz-Sáenz writes, “…its dialectal traits allow us to say it might have been written even in the late twelfth century. It is undoubtedly the oldest extant text of the poem” (23).↩︎\nAt 1,327 verses, B is the shortest among the full copies of Version T.↩︎\nEmma Campbell calls the writing support “vellum” (236).↩︎\nEmma Campbell says the binding is eighteenth-century, and she provides a transcription of the modern table of contents (236).↩︎\nThis provenance is summarized on the webpage “Canonici” on the Digital Bodleian.↩︎\nSee also Ogden, Hagiography 27-33, and Campbell, Gift 205ff., on the compilation of the manuscript.↩︎\nT-E would be the longest copy were it not for the lacuna of approximately sixty verses lost due to mutilation. Dembowski notes in his edition that copy T-C “a été remanié au commencement et des vers y ont été ajoutés à plusieurs reprises” (26), but also, C is lacking in some verses otherwise found in A. Dembowski writes, “La conclusion du poème est plus abrupte dans C; il y manque 17 vers en comparaison avec A” (30n121).↩︎\nT-F1 is also dated to this period, but T-C may be considered the latest full copy.↩︎\nBarker-Benfield notes that this late medieval catalog, which has been made available in print thanks to the Corpus of British Medieval Library Catalogues initiative, “may have taken almost a century to reach its existing late fifteenth-century form” (vol. 1, l).↩︎\nThe flyleaf was apparently separated from the manuscript after it left Canterbury. “The stray flyleaf is bound into the Collectanea of Brian Twyne, vol. 7” (Barker-Benfield, vol. 2, 1428).↩︎\nIn his introduction, Barker-Benfield describes how the late medieval trend toward lay book production affected the abbey’s collection: “The evidence for books at StA during the later 12th and 13th cent. echoes the general pattern of European book-production, when the monastic scriptoria were being overtaken by lay producers. As if through privatization, the abbey’s library came to be stocked less from its own communal scriptorium than from the scholarly activities and acquisitions of individual monks. The books so acquired were much more likely to have been made outside the abbey or obtained second-hand” (vol. 1, lxiii).↩︎\nThe latest available date we have linking Dee to CCC 232 is 1583 as the manuscript appears in the catalog of his library that year (Thomson 117).↩︎\n“Die Namen Zosimas und Maria ließen sofort erkennen, daß es sich um das Leben der h. Maria aegyptiaca handelte, und bei weiterem Nachsehn ergab sich, daß man es weder mit Adgars noch mit Rustebuefs Gedicht über diesen Gegenstand zu tun hatte, sondern mit demjenigen, das nach einer Handschrift von Corpus Christi College in Oxford Cooke in London 1852 veröffentlicht hat in, Robert Grossetete’s Chasteau d’amour, to which are added «La Vie de Sainte Marie Egyptienne» and an English version of the Chasteau d’amour. Now first edited by M. Cooke’ (Publications of the Caxton Society)…” (Tobler 967).↩︎\nThe rubric reads “Ici come[n]ce la vie sainte marie legipciene.” on a single line.↩︎\nBoth editors briefly describe Français 19525 in their editions (Rankka 39-41; Ruelle 12-13).↩︎\n“En effet, le scribe comprenait très mal la métrique. Il a considérablement abrégé le poème surtout dans la partie finale (v. 1115 et suiv.)” (26)↩︎\nA: ff.1-66v; B: ff.67-122, ff.133-202; C: ff.123-132; and a later fourteenth/fifteenth-century hand on f.204↩︎\nDelisle describes this history of the BnF’s acquisition of more than 9,000 volumes from the Saint-Germain-des-Prés collection in his chapter “Suite du Régime révolutionnaire — La bibliothèque de Saint-Germain-des-Prés” (40-58). Français 19525 was one among approximately 2,800 other French, Italian, and Spanish manuscripts from the library of Séguier (Delisle 50).↩︎\nAbout forty lines of text — the last four lines from the recto and some thirty-six lines scattered across the verso — are almost entirely unreadable with the naked eye.↩︎\nAccording to a sticker included in its back cover, this manuscript was restored at Richelieu in 2009.↩︎\nThere are two leaves missing from between folios 3 and 4; one between folios 7 and 8; one between folios 34 and 35; one between folios 42 and 43; three missing from between folios 47 and 48; one between folios 296 and 297; and four missing from between folios 349 and 350.↩︎\nIt is difficult to visualize the size and positioning of folios 23, 222, and 336 based solely on the digitization of Arsenal 3516 available on Gallica. Online, each of these folios appear isolated against a white background and are the same size as all of the other folio images, but when viewed in-person, these folios are an obvious disruption with the larger, neighboring folios peaking out significantly from behind. Folio 23 has a single column layout with 27 lines on its recto and 28 on its verso; folio 222 has a two column layout with 40 lines on each side; and folio 336 has two columns of 40 lines each on its recto and one column of 35 lines on its verso.↩︎\n“Il pourrait s’agir, …, soit d’un riche bourgeois de Saint-Omer, soit de deux frères du roi Louis IX: Charles Ier d’Anjou, qui pourrait l’avoir reçu en cadeau à l’occasion de son mariage avec Marguerite de Tonnerre, fille d’Études, duc de Bourgogne; ou Robert II d’Artois, lors de son adoubement” (qtd. in Françoise Laurent et al. 36-37).↩︎\nBased on the calendar featured in the beginning of the manuscript (ff.1r-2v) Dembowski offers a dating of 1265, but Guggenbühl offers an extensive justification to situate the entirety of Arsenal 3516 to the years 1267/1268 (5-14). Likewise, in the introduction to Blacker, Burgess, and Ogden’s edition of Wace’s Life of St Margaret, we have the description “Probably completed in 1267 or 1268 and could have been copied at Hesdin, at the court of the counts of Artois” (Blacker et al. 149).↩︎\n“… il est à mettre sur le compte d’une intervention fautive d’un copiste picard à cet endroit” (Françoise Laurent et al. 47). A thorough analysis of the language in Arsenal 3516 is offered in this edition of Wace as well (46-66).↩︎\nThis trait is observable in the verse “ou ele soloit faire les geus” (v.690), which in T-E reads “ou ele seut faire ses gieus.”↩︎\nThe medieval table of contents neglects to list the Life of Saint Juliane, which may lead one to mistakenly believe that the text immediately following Mary the Egyptian is the Life of Saint Catherine (ff.121r-125r) especially since these texts have lost their identifying rubrics as a result of the cut out miniatures.↩︎\n“Notre poème a une lacune considérable, car les feuillets qui devaient porter les numéros 282 et 283 ont été arrachés. Il manque ainsi 240 vers” (26).↩︎\nOn the topic of scribal hands in Add. 36614, Roach writes, “Several hands are involved: Chrétien’s Perceval was copied by a scribe who wrote in Francian with a Picard inmixture; the Continuations show at least two hands, the first of which is more definitely Picard; the intercalated Bliocadran is by a northeastern scribe; and finally a fourteenth-century hand has added in the last twelve folios a Vita Mariae Aegyptiacae in French verse.” (xx)↩︎\nThis dating is agreed upon by Micha (62) and Roach (xx) in their respective editions.↩︎\nIt seems Barrois may either be referred to as “Joseph” or “Paul”; the Ashburnham Library catalog of the auction of the Barrois manuscripts says the collection was “formed by M. Paul Barrois” (iii).↩︎\nhttps://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1901-1230-1↩︎\nIn addition to the 12 parchment folios, which the John Rylands record refers to as “vellum”, French 6 is also bound with 2 paper front pages and 24 end paper pages. The front pages are included in the digitization of this manuscript, but the end pages are not included in the digitization. These pages feature chainlines and unidentified watermarks.↩︎\nFawtier and Fawtier-Jones provide descriptions of each of these.↩︎\nDembowski refers to it as “un petit fragment anglo-norman de 162 vers correspondant aux 168 premiers vers de notre édition” (27).↩︎\nRussell recounts this chain of acquisition in his bulletin (41) based on the descriptions of both Ker (433) and Fawtier and Fawtier-Jones who also note that French 6 may have been Lot #1119 of the Libri auction based on that lot’s description (322).↩︎\nThere are minor spelling differences between these copies, though T-F1 has been more extensively abbreviated by the scribe. T-D and T-F1 only noticeably differ in verse 164 where copy D offers “N’out onkes tele meschine” and copy F1 offers “N’out el chef plus bele crine.”↩︎\nBased on my own observations of BnF Français 19525 and on the description of Egerton 2710 available on Arlima (https://arlima.net/no/4668), BnF Français 19525 is smaller than Egerton 2710, which measures 265x180mm with 40-42 lines per column.↩︎\nIt is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about how any of these Version T copies are related to one another, but Duncan Robertson offers a scheme based on what little we do know of the origins of Version T in which T-E and T-C seem to have a shared source, T-B and T-L seem to have a shared source, and T-A, T-D, and the two fragments seem to be related to one another with T-D and T-F1 the most closely linked (“The Anglo-Norman Verse Life” 30).↩︎\nThe other Old French fragments found in the Damascus geniza include an apologetic poem against Judaic criticisms, a bifolium of Fierabras, and scraps of Enfances Godefroi.↩︎\n“Von geringerer Bedeutung noch als die Stücke des Fierabras ist, was wir auf den zwei Seiten eines nicht ganz unbeschädigten Pergamentblättchens…” (966)↩︎\nIn their introduction to The Damascus Fragments (2020), D’Ottone Rambach, Hirschler, and Vollandt provide a detailed account of the last known locations for the full corpus of the fragments of the Qubbat al-khazna, and they reframe this history in such a way that the role of the Ottomans in managing this research is made much clearer and more active. They write, “In particular, when it comes to the temporary loan of some of the fragments to Germany, it appears very clear that the Ottomans, both in Damascus and in Istanbul, made all the efforts needed in order to document the fragments through photographs and ensure that they would get them back” (38). In addition to recounting the return of the collection of fragments photographed in Berlin to Damascus in 1909, they describe the existence of a handlist and a duplicate set of photographs first produced by the Ottomans prior to loaning the fragments to the Germans to ensure the return of all the loaned fragments. Like the original fragments themselves though, the location of this handlist and set of photographs is also unknown.↩︎\nThis set of verse numbers are based on Cooke’s 1852 edition.↩︎\nEven the photographic reproductions of T-F2 are rather small, with the verso photograph (no. 89) measuring 107x65mm and the recto photograph (no. 101) measuring 107x155mm.↩︎\n“…und das Pergament unter der Wirkung von Feuchtigkeit stark verschrumpelt ist” (966). The original size of the fragment prior to this damage is unclear, but Giannini and Minervini reiterate Tobler’s account in their own description: “The folium on parchment shown on photographs nos. 101 (right [recto]) and 89 (verso) of MSS simulata orientalia 6 measured “7 Centimeter Höhe und 5 Breite”, and the lines (twenty for recto, eighteen for verso) were laid out across one column inside a frame provided with 52x32mm ruling. These measurements are skewed by the considerable shrinkage the folium suffered before 1903, ‘unter der Wirkung von Feuchtigkeit’ (under the effect of moisture), which also makes its content harder to read” (336).↩︎\nThrough comparison with the other Version T copies, these gaps can be filled in as follows:\n[Nos]tre sires l’aveit si chere\n[Q]ue plus que dos piez e demie\n[A]veit entre la tere e le\n↩︎\nAn obvious feature of T-F2 is the sudden change in ink and thickness of the letters that occurs on the thirteenth line of the recto onward.↩︎\n“… the portable unbound or roughly assembled booklets meant not for preservation, but for fast-paced and poorly organised circulation, having made it to the modern age thanks to nothing but exceptional and fortuitous circumstances… In the face of such an imposing body of preserved material, we sometimes tend to forget that the true vehicle of circulation of medieval literature, the libellus or booklet… which was meant to be sewn roughly and often left without a cover [and] is utterly off limits to us by virtue of its inability to cross the barrier of time without the rare help of exceptional circumstances (the Damascus geniza, for example)” (351).↩︎\nGiannini and Minervini provide an in-depth analysis of the available fragment image and conclude that the fragment was most likely produced in Europe as it does not “share any grapho-phonetic or lexical peculiarities with the Outremer French scripta” (345). Radiciotti and D’Ottone likewise point to a twelfth-century, European origin story for the Old French pieces present among the Damascus fragments (“I frammenti della Qubba” 58).↩︎",
